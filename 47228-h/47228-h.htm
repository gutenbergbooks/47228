<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>This volume deals with the myths and legends of
India, which survive to us in the rich and abundant storehouse
of Sanskrit literature, and with the rise and growth
of Brahmanism, Buddhism, Jainism, &amp;c. The reader is
introduced to the various sacred works of the Hindus,
including the ancient invocatory hymns of the four Vedas,
the later speculative and expository &#8220;Forest Books&#8221; in
which &#8220;the Absolute is grasped and proclaimed&#8221;, and
those great epic poems the <i>Rámáyana</i>, which is three
times longer than the <i>Iliad</i>, and the <i>Máhábharata</i>, which
is four times longer than the <i>Rámáyana</i>. In no other
country have the national poets given fuller and finer
expression to the beliefs and ideals and traditions of a
people, or achieved as a result wider and more enduring
fame. At the present day over two hundred million
Hindus are familiar in varying degrees with the legendary
themes and traditional beliefs which the ancient forest
sages and poets of India invested with much beautiful
symbolism, and used as mediums for speculative thought
and profound spiritual teachings. The sacred books of
India are to the Hindus what the Bible is to Christians.
Those who read them, or hear them read, are believed to
be assured of prosperity in this world and of salvation in
the next. To students of history, of ethnology, and of
comparative religion they present features of peculiar
interest, for they contain an elaborate sociology of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[Pg ii]</a></span>
ancient Aryo-Indians, their political organizations, their
codes of laws, their high ethical code, and above all their
conceptions of God, the soul, and the Universe. Some
knowledge of them is necessary for those who desire to
approach with sympathy the investigation of the religious
beliefs of our Hindu fellow men and to understand their
outlook upon life and the world.</p>

<p>The Introduction deals with various aspects of the
study of these ancient myths and legends which have been
the inspiration of a national literature infused with much
grandeur and sublimity. The historic Aryan controversy,
of which the science of comparative mythology is a by-product,
is passed under review, and it is shown to what
extent philological theories regarding race problems have
been modified during recent years as a result of the
adoption of broader and more exact methods of ethnic
and archæological research and the ever-extending study
of comparative mythology. There has also been condensed
much important data dealing with the early phases
of Aryo-Indian civilization accumulated for historical purposes
by industrious and painstaking Sanskrit scholars
who have been engaged in investigating and systematizing
the internal evidence of the various religious poems and
treatises. It will be found that no general agreement has
yet been reached regarding Aryo-Indian chronology, but
it now appears to be well established that although there
were early cultural as well as racial &#8220;drifts&#8221;, fresh invasions,
which had far-reaching results in the social and
religious life of northern India, occurred at a late period
in what is known as the Vedic Age. In consequence, the
problem presented by this ancient civilization tends rather
to grow more complex than to become simplified. Its
origin is still wrapped in obscurity. At the very dawn
of history Aryo-Indian culture had attained a comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</a></span>
high state of development, and a considerable period
must be allowed for its growth. Even some of the
ancient Vedic hymns, addressed by priests to the deities,
are styled &#8220;new songs&#8221;, which suggests the existence of
an older collection. Many of them also afford indications
that immemorial beliefs were in process of change and
fusion. The sublime deities, Varuna and Mitra (Mithra),
for instance, were already declining in splendour. Yet
they must have been closely associated with Indra, king
of the gods, in the unknown Aryan homeland, as is made
evident by an inscription recently deciphered at Boghaz
Köi, in Asia Minor, which refers to them as deities of the
mysterious Mitanni people who were of Aryan speech
like the settlers in the Punjab. There is no evidence,
however, that the Mitanni rulers gave recognition to the
fire god Agni, who in India was exalted as the twin
brother of Indra. The problem involved may not be
devoid of ethnic significance, although the identity of
the Agni-worshipping section of the early raiders
remains obscure.</p>

<p>During the early Vedic Age in India prominence was
given to the gods: the social organization was of patriarchal
character; the goddesses remained shadowy and
vague, some being, indeed, little more than figures of
speech. A great change took place, however, after the
invasions of the Bharata and other tribes who are now
referred to as &#8220;late comers&#8221;. Profound and speculative
thinkers attained to the pantheistic conception of the
world soul; new doctrines, which are not referred to
in the Vedic hymns, regarding the ages of the universe
and transmigration of souls, received wide acceptance
as the result of missionary efforts: the Vedic gods were
reduced to the position of minor deities and new goddesses
rose into prominence, one indeed being Bharati,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
the tribal deity of the Bharatas, who became associated
with the Saraswati river and under her new name was
ultimately made the wife of the supreme god Brahma.
It is significant to note that the new culture radiated from
the &#8220;Middle Country&#8221;, the area controlled by the &#8220;late
comers&#8221;. That it contained elements which were not
of Indian origin is made clearly evident when we find
that the doctrines of the ages of the universe and
transmigration of souls were shared by other peoples,
including the Greeks and Celts and a section of the
ancient Egyptians. Sumero-Babylonian and Egyptian
resemblances may also be traced in post-Vedic religious
literature, the former, for instance, in the Deluge legend,
and the latter in the myth regarding the avenging goddess
Kali, who slaughters the enemies of the gods like
Hathor-Sekhet, and has similarly to be restrained by one
of the deities. The worship of goddesses was also prominent
among the Sumerians, Egyptians, Greeks, and
Celts, as contrasted with the worship of gods among
broad-headed mountain and wandering peoples. In this
connection special interest attaches to the conclusions of
prominent ethnologists, who include in the Mediterranean
or &#8220;Brown&#8221; race of brunet &#8220;long heads&#8221; the early
Egyptians and Neolithic Europeans, the Sumerians and
present-day &#8220;Aryan&#8221; types in India, and especially in
the old &#8220;Middle Country&#8221; and Bengal. On the other
hand, a broad-headed type is still prominent in the
Punjab, the area occupied by the earliest invaders who
worshipped the Vedic gods. Dr. Haddon suggests that
these pioneers of civilization were mixed with peoples of
Mongolian and other affinities. Some such ethnic explanation
must be urged to account for the differences
between Vedic and post-Vedic mythologies. The invasions
of the &#8220;late comers&#8221;, who entered India by a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
route, no doubt stimulated thought and promoted culture
after settled conditions were secured, as was undoubtedly
the result of the mingling of races elsewhere.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be put down as an axiom&#8221;, says Professor
Jastrow, &#8220;that nowhere does a high form of culture arise
without the commingling of diverse ethnic elements.
Civilization, like the spark emitted by the striking of
steel on flint, is everywhere the result of stimulus evoked
by the friction of one ethnic group upon another&#8221;: and
he supports his theory with the evidence afforded by
Egypt, Babylonia, Greece, Rome, France, Germany, and
Great Britain, as well as the present-day United States
of America, &#8220;the melting pot&#8221; of many peoples.</p>

<p>Throughout this volume comparative evidence is
provided to assist the reader towards the study of this
most interesting aspect of the Aryan problem. We trace
the cremation custom, which has prevailed in India since
Vedic times, to countries as wide apart as Great Britain,
into which it was introduced during the Bronze Age, and
Southern Siberia, where it is still practised by the Mongolian
Buriats. Over the areas occupied by representatives
of the Mediterranean race it was unknown prior
to the invasions of unidentified fire-worshippers. Special
interest also attaches to the horse sacrifice, which was
also an Aryo-Indian ceremony even in Vedic times. It
is not yet unknown among the Buriats. At one time
the horse sacrifice was widely prevalent. White horses
were sacrificed to the sun in Ancient Greece; the sun
horses are referred to with horror by Ezekiel; the ceremony
was also connected with the mysteries of Aricia
grove. Indeed, as is pointed out in <a href="#CHAPTER_V_Social_and_Religious_Developments_of_the_Vedic_Age">Chapter V</a>, various
ancient peoples offered up this domesticated and historic
animal. In the Indian epics and religious treatises there
are illuminating references to the horse sacrifice which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
throw much light on the significance of the immemorial
practice. White and black horses were alternately favoured,
and it is evident that the practice was not only
associated with solar worship, but was also intended to
secure fertility&mdash;crops, and therefore rain in the first place,
increase of flocks, herds, human offspring, &amp;c.&mdash;as is
undoubtedly the case among the modern-day Buriats.
In India the horse was also offered up as a sin offering,
a late conception, evidently. A prominent feature of this
sacrifice in most countries was the decapitation of the
sacrificial victim. Recent evidence from Egypt suggests
that the sacrifice of the ass may have preceded the sacrifice
of the horse. Professor Flinders Petrie has found
in a triple tomb in the early dynastic Tarkhan cemetery
the skeletons of three asses with the heads cut off and
placed beside them. He suggests that the animals were
killed to accompany their owner to the other world. The
Buriats still sacrifice horses at graves, professedly for the
same reason. As this custom was not prevalent throughout
Ancient Egypt, it may have been an importation, connected,
perhaps, with the myth about the sun-ass which
gallops round a hill-surrounded world followed by the
pursuing night serpent. An isolated reference is also
made to the sacrifice of the ass in a Twelfth Dynasty
story about a Naga-like demigod, a fact which emphasizes
the historical importance of the material embedded in
folk tales and mythologies. In this connection it may
be noted that certain developed myths suggest there may
have been either a cultural contact of Ancient Egypt with
India, through an unidentified medium, or an infusion
of religious ideas into both countries from a common
source. In an Indian creation myth Prajápati weeps
creative tears like the Egyptian sun-god Ra, whose rays
are tears from which all things spring, as Maspero shows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span></p>

<p>In India the juice of the soma plant was identified
with the vital principle, and the demons were the poisoners
of crops and plants; in Egypt honey-flowers and sacred
trees sprang from the fertilizing tears of deities, while
the tears of demons produced poisonous plants, diseases,
&amp;c. Like the Egyptian Horus, the Indian Prajápati,
or Brahma, sprang from a lotus bloom floating on the
primordial waters. The chaos-egg myth is also common
to both mythological systems. Brahma issues from a
golden egg like Ra, and a similar myth is connected with
the Egyptian Ptah and Khnumu, and with the Chinese
P'an Ku, while the egg figures in Eur-Asian folk tales
which contain the germs of the various mythologies.
All mythologies have animistic bases; they were, to begin
with, systematized folk beliefs which were carried hither
and thither in various stages of development by migrating
and trading peoples. Each separate system bears undoubted
traces of racial or local influences; each reflects
the civilization in which it flourished, the habits of thought
and habits of life of the people, and the religious, ethical,
and political ideals of their rulers and teachers. When
well-developed myths of similar character are found in
widely separated districts, an ethnic or cultural contact is
suggested. Such myths may be regarded as evidence of
remote racial movements, which, although unsupported
by record or tradition, are also indicated by ethnological
data. It is hoped that the reader will find much suggestive
material in this connection in their study of the
myths and legends of India. They will also find that
many of the tales retold in this volume have qualities
which make universal appeal, and that some are among
the most beautiful which survive from the civilizations
of the ancient world.</p>

<p>Not a few, we are assured, will follow with interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
the development from primitive myths of great and
ennobling ideas which have exercised a culturing influence
in India through many long centuries, and are still potent
factors in the domestic, social, and religious life of many
millions of Hindus.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>


<p>The triangular sub-continent of India is cut off from
the rest of Asia by the vast barriers of the Himalayas,
the Hindu Kush, the Suleiman mountains, and the Indian
Ocean. Its population comprises about two hundred and
ninety-five millions, and is of greatest density on the fertile
northern plain, which is watered by three river systems,
the Indus and its tributaries on the west, and the Ganges
and Brahmaputra with their tributaries which pour into the
Bay of Bengal. South of the Vindhya mountain ranges is
the plateau of the Deccan. The climate varies from temperate
on the Himalayan slopes to tropical in southern
India, and over the entire country there are two pronounced
annual seasons, the dry and the rainy.</p>

<p>Our interest abides in this volume chiefly with the
northern plain and the people who are familiar in varying
degrees with the sacred and heroic literature passed under
review; that is, with the scenes of the early Indian civilization
known as Aryan and those numerous inheritors
of Aryan traditions, the Hindus, who exceed two hundred
and seven millions of the population of India. Modern
Hinduism embraces a number of cults which are connected
with the early religious doctrines of the Aryanized or
Brahmanized India of the past; it recognizes, among
other things, the ancient caste system which includes distinct
racial types varying from what is known as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
Aryan to the pre-Dravidian stocks. Other religious
organizations may be referred to in passing. Buddhists
are chiefly confined to Burma, Sikhs number two millions,
the Mohammedans nearly sixty-three millions, while the
Parsees number roughly ninety-five thousand; less than
three million natives and half-castes are Christians.</p>

<p>Like Egypt, India is a land of ancient memories, but
its history, or rather pre-history, does not begin until
about a thousand years after the erection was completed
of the great pyramids at Gizeh. Between 2000 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> and
1200 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> tribes of pastoral and patriarchal peoples of
Aryan speech were pouring over the north-western frontier
and settling in the Punjab. There are no written or inscribed
records, or even native traditions, of this historic
migration, but we are able to follow vaguely, from the
references found in religious compositions, the gradual
conquest of northern India, which covered a period of
several centuries. To what extent this invasion was racial,
rather than cultural, it is extremely difficult to discover.
But no doubt can be entertained regarding the influence
exercised by the ancient military aristocracy and their religious
teachers. Certain of the Aryan gods still receive
recognition in India after a lapse of over three thousand
years. This fact makes Indian mythology of special interest
to the ever-increasing number of students of comparative
religion.</p>

<p>Indian mythology also possesses particular attractions
for us on account of its intimate association with what is
known as the &#8220;Aryan problem&#8221;. Scholars of a past
generation held pronounced views on Aryan matters,
and produced a considerable literature of highly controversial
character. In fact, theories regarding the Aryan
languages and the Aryan &#8220;race&#8221; are as varied as they are
numerous; the wordy warfare which occupied the greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
part of the nineteenth century, was waged ever strenuously
and not infrequently with much brilliance; occasionally,
however, it was not awanting in the undesirable elements
of personal feeling and national antipathy. But, happily,
we appear to have reached a time when this fascinating
and important problem can be considered dispassionately
in the proper scientific spirit, and without experiencing that
unnecessary dread of having to abandon decided opinions
which may have been formed when the accumulated
data had less variety and bulk than that which is now
available. This change has been brought about by the
extended study of comparative religion and the wonderful
and engaging results which have attended modern-day
methods of ethnic and archæological research.</p>

<p>The Aryan controversy had its origin at the close of
the eighteenth century, when that distinguished Oriental
scholar Sir William Jones, who acted for a period as a
judge of the Supreme Court in Bengal, drew attention to
the remarkable resemblances between the Sanskrit, Greek,
Latin, German, and Celtic languages. In 1808, Schlegel
published his <i>Language and Wisdom of the Hindus</i>, and
urged the theory that India was the home of an ancestral
race and a group of languages that were progenitors of
various European ones. Other scholars subsequently
favoured Zend, the language of Persia, and transferred
the &#8220;racial beehive&#8221; to that country; rival claims were
afterwards set up for Asia Minor and the Iranian plateau.</p>

<p>The science of Comparative Philology was a direct
product of these early controversies; it was established
in the &#8220;thirties&#8221; when Bopp published his Comparative
Grammar in which a new term, having a racial significance,
was invented: he grouped all European languages, except
Basque, Magyar, Turkish, and Finnish, as &#8220;Indo-Germanic&#8221;.
After the study of Sanskrit literature revealed, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
that the Aryans occupied but a small part of India when
their sacred hymns, the Vedas, were composed, the cradle
of the Aryan race was shifted to some uncertain area
beyond the Himalayan mountains.</p>

<p>Max Müller, the distinguished Sanskrit authority,
who in the words of an Indian scholar &#8220;devoted his lifetime
to the elucidation of the learning, literature, and
religion of ancient India&#8221;,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> abandoned Bopp's patriotic
term &#8220;Indo-Germanic&#8221; and adopted Aryan, which he
founded on the Sanskrit racial designation &#8220;Arya&#8221;. At
first he accepted the theory of an Aryan race and especially
of an Aryan civilization which originated on the Central
Asian plateau, but, as will be seen, he subsequently modified
his views in this regard.</p>

<p>A new theory regarding the Aryans, who are now more
commonly referred to as Indo-Europeans, was strongly
advocated in 1851 and later by Dr. Robert Gordon
Latham, who devoted many years to the study of ethnology
and philology. He argued that as the major part
of the peoples speaking Indo-European tongues was
found in Europe, the cradle of the race might, after all,
be transferred westward. This theory was supported by
the fact (among others) that the Lithuanian language was
no less archaic than Sanskrit.</p>

<p>The European hypothesis found in time many able
supporters, and the advocates of rival Teutonic and Celtic
claims waxed eloquent and heated over the exact location
of the Aryan homeland. An industrious search was meanwhile
conducted for words common to all Aryan languages
which described the natural features of the racial &#8220;cradle&#8221;.
This work of reconstruction was certainly not lacking in
picturesque results, for attractive visions were presented of
Aryan Arcadias in which the simple and contemplative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>ancestors of many bitter controversialists dwelt together in
exemplary unity and peace. The question of location might
remain unsettled, but it was generally agreed that the
ancient people were surrounded by cows, sheep, and goats;
sometimes they rode their horses or yoked them in rough
rumbling carts, and sometimes they ate them. No asses
were admitted to the fold because of their decided partiality
for Central Asian plains, which seemed quite reasonable.
Trouble was occasionally caused by wolves and bears, or,
mayhap, a stray lion, but these and other worries associated
with the simple life might be compensated for by the fact
that the primitive people, as one writer<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> put it, &#8220;understood
the art of drinking&#8221;. Mead, brewed from honey,
was found to be &#8220;dear to the hearts of the ancient Aryans&#8221;;
had the Brahman ever forgotten his &#8220;madhu&#8221;, the Welshman
his &#8220;medhu&#8221;, or the Lithuanian his &#8220;medus&#8221;?
Problems arose regarding the ancients' knowledge of trees:
it was found that &#8220;bhaga&#8221; was applied indifferently by
the family groups to the beech and the oak, and more
than one ingenious explanation was suggested to account
for this apparent discrepancy. Then, suddenly, Professor
Max Müller swept into the background the rival Aryan
homeland pictures, pointing out the while that it is &#8220;almost
impossible to discover any animal or any plant that
is peculiar to the north of Europe and is not found sporadically
in Asia also&#8221;. Destructive criticism proceeded
apace, until now nothing has been left to us of the ancestral
Arcadia but &#8220;air, water, heat and cold&#8221;. In his
review of the widely accepted philological &#8220;evidence&#8221; regarding
the Aryan homeland, Max Müller declared it
to be so pliant that it was possible &#8220;to make out a more
or less plausible case for any part of the world&#8221;. The
advanced group of philologists held, indeed, that no racial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>centre could be located. Ultimately &#8220;Delbrück went so
far,&#8221; says Professor Ripley, &#8220;as to deny that any single
parent language ever existed in fact&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile ethnologists and archæologists were engaged
accumulating important data. It was found that Europe
had been invaded at the close of the Stone Age by a
broad-headed (brachycephalic) people, who brought no
culture and even retarded the growth of civilization in
their areas of settlement. A new problem was thus presented:
were the Aryans a brachycephalic (broad-headed)
or a dolichocephalic (long-headed) people? Its solution
was rendered all the more difficult when it was found that
living representatives of both racial types were peoples of
Aryan speech. The idea that skull shapes, which are
associated with other distinct physical characteristics, were
due to habits of life and the quality of food which had
to be masticated, was in time advanced to discredit
new methods of ethnic research, but it has since been
thoroughly disproved. In many ancient graves are found
skulls which do not differ from those of modern men and
women, living under different conditions and eating different
food.</p>

<p>Patriotic controversialists were not awanting again in
dealing with the problem of varying skull shapes. French
scientists, for instance, have identified the &#8220;broad heads&#8221;,
now generally known as the Alpine race, with the ubiquitous
Celts, but as present-day Hindus are mainly
&#8220;long heads&#8221;, the Aryan racial connection here suggested
remains obscure. A clue to the mystery was
sought for in Asia Minor, but no satisfactory result could
be obtained there to support philological theories, because
the Armenians, who are &#8220;broad heads&#8221;, and their enemies
and neighbours the Kurds, who are &#8220;long heads&#8221;, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>
both peoples of Aryan speech. A scornful scientist has
dismissed as a &#8220;prehistoric romance&#8221;, the theory that the
fair Scandinavian &#8220;long heads&#8221; are identical with the
brunet &#8220;long heads&#8221; of India. Both the Celtic (Alpine)
and Indo-Germanic racial theories are as inconclusive as
they are diametrically in opposition.</p>

<p>The science of philology, which, at its inception,
&#8220;dazzled and silenced all&#8221;, has been proved to be no safe
guide in racial matters. We must avoid, as Professor
Ripley says, &#8220;the error of confusing community of language
with identity of race. Nationality may often follow
linguistic boundaries, but race bears no necessary relation
whatever to them.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>By way of illustration, it may be pointed out in this
connection that English is spoken at the present day by,
among others, the Hong Kong Chinamen, the American
Red Indians and negroes, by the natives of Ireland,
Wales, Cornwall, and the Scottish Highlands, besides
the descendants of the ancient Britons, the Jutes, the
Angles, the Saxons, the Norsemen, the Danes, and the
Normans in England, but all these peoples cannot be
classified in the racial sense simply as Englishmen.
Similarly, the varied types of humanity who are Aryan
in speech cannot all be regarded as representatives of the
&#8220;Aryan race&#8221;, that is, if we accept the theory of an
&#8220;Aryan race&#8221;, which Virchow, by the way, has characterized
as &#8220;a pure fiction&#8221;.</p>

<p>Max Müller, in his closing years, faced this aspect
of the problem frankly and courageously. &#8220;Aryas&#8221;, he
wrote,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span> &#8220;are those who speak Aryan languages, whatever
their colour, whatever their blood. In calling them Aryas
we predicate nothing of them except that the grammar
of their language is Aryan.... I have declared again
and again that if I say Aryas, I mean neither blood, nor
bones, nor hair, nor skull; I mean simply those who
speak an Aryan language. The same applies to Hindus,
Greeks, Romans, Germans, Celts, and Slavs. When I
speak of these I commit myself to no anatomical characteristics.
The blue-eyed and fair-haired Scandinavians
may have been conquerors or conquered, they may have
adopted the language of their darker lords or their subjects,
or vice versa. I assert nothing beyond their language
when I call them Hindus, Greeks, Romans, Germans,
Celts, and Slavs, and in that sense, and in that sense
only, do I say that even the blackest Hindus represent
an earlier stage of Aryan speech and thought than the
fairest Scandinavians.... To me an ethnologist who
speaks of an Aryan race, Aryan blood, Aryan eyes and
hair, is as great a sinner as a linguist who speaks of a
dolichocephalic dictionary or a brachycephalic grammar.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Aryan, however, has been found to be a convenient
term, and even ethnologists do not scorn its use, although
it has been applied &#8220;in a confusing variety of signification
by different philologists&#8221;. One application of it is
to the language group comprising Sanskrit, Persian,
Afghan, &amp;c. Some still prefer it to &#8220;Indo-European&#8221;,
which has found rivals in &#8220;Afro-European&#8221;, among
those who connect the Aryan languages with North
Africa, and &#8220;Afro-Eurasian&#8221;, which may be regarded as
universal in its racial application, especially if we accept
Darwin's theory that the Garden of Eden was located
somewhere in Africa.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> We may think of the Aryans as
we do of the British when that term is used to include
the peoples embraced by the British Empire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span></p>

<p>In India the Aryans were from late Vedic times divided
into four castes&mdash;Brahmans (priests), Kshatriyas (kings
and warriors), Vaisyas (traders, &amp;c.), and Sudras (aborigines).</p>

<p>Caste (Varna) signifies &#8220;colour&#8221;, but it is not certain
whether the reference is to be given a physical or mythological
application. The first three castes were Aryans,
the fairest people; the fourth caste, that comprising the
dark-skinned aborigines, was non-Aryan. &#8220;Arya&#8221;, however,
was not always used in the sense that we have
been accustomed to apply &#8220;Aryo-Indian&#8221;. In one of
the sacred books of the ancient people it is stated:
&#8220;The colour of the Brahmans was white; that of the
Kshatriyas red; that of the Vaisyas yellow; and that
of the Sudras black&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> This colour reference connects
&#8220;caste&#8221; with the doctrine of yugas, or ages of the universe
(<a href="#CHAPTER_VI_Mysteries_of_Creation">Chapter VI</a>).</p>

<p>Risley, dealing with &#8220;the leading castes and tribes in
Northern India, from the Bay of Bengal to the frontiers
of Afghanistan&#8221;, concludes from the data obtained from
census returns, that we are able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span> &#8220;to distinguish two
extreme types of feature and physique, which may be
provisionally described as Aryan and Dravidian. A third
type, which in some respects may be looked upon as
intermediate between these two, while in other, and perhaps
the most important, points it can hardly be deemed
Indian at all, is found along the northern and eastern
borders of Bengal. The most prominent characters are
a relatively short (brachycephalic) head, a broad face, a
short, wide nose, very low in the bridge, and in extreme
cases almost bridgeless; high and projecting cheekbones
and eyelids, peculiarly formed so as to give the impression
that the eyes are obliquely set in the head....
This type ... may be conveniently described as
Mongoloid....&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>According to Risley, the Aryan type is dolichocephalic
(long-headed), &#8220;with straight, finely-cut (lepto-rhine)
nose, a long, symmetrical narrow face, a well-developed
forehead, regular features, and a high facial angle&#8221;. The
stature is &#8220;fairly high&#8221;, and the body is &#8220;well proportioned,
and slender rather than massive&#8221;. The complexion
is &#8220;a very light transparent brown&mdash;&#8216;wheat
coloured&#8217; is the common vernacular description&mdash;noticeably
fairer than the mass of the population&#8221;.</p>

<p>The Dravidian head, the same authority states,
&#8220;usually inclines to be dolichocephalic&#8221;, but &#8220;all other
characters present a marked contrast to the Aryan. The
nose is thick and broad, and the formula expressing its
proportionate dimensions is higher than in any known
race, except the Negro. The facial angle is comparatively
low; the lips are thick; the face wide and fleshy;
the features coarse and irregular.&#8221; The stature is lower
than that of the Aryan type: &#8220;the figure is squat and
the limbs sturdy. The colour of the skin varies from
very dark brown to a shade closely approaching black....
Between these extreme types&#8221;, adds Risley, &#8220;we
find a large number of intermediate groups.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Of late years ethnologists have inclined to regard the
lower types represented by hill and jungle tribes, the
Veddas of Ceylon, &amp;c., as pre-Dravidians. The brunet
and long-headed Dravidians may have entered India long
before the Aryans: they resemble closely the Brahui of
Baluchistan and the Man-tse of China.</p>

<p>India is thus mainly long-headed (dolichocephalic).
We have already seen, however, that in northern and
eastern Bengal there are traces of an infusion of Mongolian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span>
&#8220;broad heads&#8221;; another brachycephalic element
is pronounced in western India, but it is not Mongolian;
possibly we have here evidences of a settlement of Alpine
stock. According to Risley, these western broad heads
are the descendants of invading Scythians,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> but this theory
is not generally accepted.</p>

<p>The Eur-Asian Alpine race of broad heads are a
mountain people distributed from Hindu Kush westward
to Brittany. On the land bridge of Asia Minor
they are represented by the Armenians. Their eastern
prehistoric migrations is by some ethnologists believed
to be marked by the Ainus of Japan. They are mostly
a grey-eyed folk, with dark hair and abundant moustache
and beard, as contrasted with the Mongols, whose facial
hair is scanty. There are short and long varieties of
Alpine stock, and its representatives are usually sturdy
and muscular. In Europe these broad-headed invaders
overlaid a long-headed brunet population, as the early
graves show, but in the process of time the broad heads
have again retreated mainly to their immemorial upland
habitat. At the present day the Alpine race separates the
long-headed fair northern race from what is known as
the long-headed dark Mediterranean race of the south.</p>

<p>A slighter and long-headed brunet type is found south
of Hindu Kush. Ripley has condensed a mass of evidence
to show that it is akin to the Mediterranean race.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
He refers to it as the &#8220;eastern branch&#8221;, which includes
Afghans and Hindus. &#8220;We are all familiar with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span> type,&#8221; he says, &#8220;especially as it is emphasized by inbreeding
and selection among the Brahmans.... There
can be no doubt of their (the Eastern Mediterraneans)
racial affinities with our Berbers, Greeks, Italians, and
Spaniards. They are all members of the same race, at
once the widest in its geographical extension, the most
populous and the most primitive of our three European
types.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Professor Elliot Smith supports Professor Ripley in
this connection, and includes the Arabs with the southern
Persians in the same group, but finding the terms
&#8220;Hamitic&#8221; and &#8220;Mediterranean&#8221; insufficient, prefers
to call this widespread family the &#8220;Brown race&#8221;, to
distinguish its representatives from the fair Northerners,
the &#8220;yellow&#8221; Mongolians, and the &#8220;black&#8221; negroes.</p>

<p>North of the Alpine racial area are found the
nomadic Mongolians, who are also &#8220;broad heads&#8221;, but
with distinguishing facial characteristics which vary in
localities. As we have seen, the Mongoloid features are
traceable in India. Many settlers have migrated from
Tibet, but among the high-caste Indians the Mongoloid
eyes and high cheek bones occur in families, suggesting
early crossment.</p>

<p>Another distinctive race has yet to be accounted for&mdash;the
tall, fair, blue-eyed, long-headed Northerners, represented
by the Scandinavians of the present day. Sergi
and other ethnologists have classed this type as a variety
of the Mediterranean race, which had its area of localization
on the edge of the snow belt on lofty plateaus and
in proximity to the Arctic circle. The theory that the
distinctive blondness and great stature of the Northerners
were acquired in isolation and perpetuated by artificial
selection is, however, more suggestive than conclusive,
unless we accept the theory that acquired characteristics
can be inherited. How dark eyes became grey or blue,
and dark hair red or sandy, is a problem yet to be solved.</p>

<p>The ancestors of this fair race are believed to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span>
been originally distributed along the northern Eur-Asian
plateaus; Keane's blonde long-headed Chudes<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and the
Wu-suns in Chinese Turkestan are classed as varieties of
the ancient Northern stock. An interesting problem is
presented in this connection by the fair types among the
ancient Egyptians, the modern-day Berbers, and the blondes
of the Atlas mountains in Morocco. Sergi is inclined to
place the &#8220;cradle&#8221; of the Northerners on the edge of the
Sahara.</p>

<p>The broad-headed Turki and Ugrians are usually
referred to as a blend of the Alpine stock and the proto-Northerners,
with, in places, Mongolian admixture.</p>

<p>As most of the early peoples were nomadic, or periodically
nomadic, there must have been in localities a good
deal of interracial and intertribal fusion, with the result
that intermediate varieties were produced. It follows that
the intellectual life of the mingling peoples would be
strongly influenced by admixture as well as by contact
with great civilizations.</p>

<p>It now remains for us to deal with the Aryan problem
in India. Dr. Haddon considers that the invading Aryans
were &#8220;perhaps associated with Turki tribes&#8221; when they
settled in the Punjab.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Prior to this racial movement,
the Kassites, whose origin is obscure, assisted by bands of
Aryans, overthrew the Hammurabi dynasty in Babylon
and established the Kassite dynasty between 2000 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
and 1700 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> At this period the domesticated horse
was introduced, and its Babylonian name, &#8220;the ass of
the East&#8221;, is an indication whence it came. Another
Aryan invasion farther west is marked by the establishment
of the Mitanni kingdom between the area controlled
by the Assyrians and the Hittites. Its kings had names
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span>which are clearly Aryan. These included Saushatar,
Artatatama, Sutarna, and Tushratta. The latter was the
correspondent in the Tel-el-Amarna letters of his kinsmen
the Egyptian Pharaohs, Amenhotep the Magnificent, and
the famous Akhenaton. The two royal houses had intermarried
after the wars of Thothmes III. It is impossible
to fix the date of the rise of the Mitanni power, which
held sway for a period over Assyria, but we know that it
existed in 1500 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> The horse was introduced into
Egypt before 1580 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>It is generally believed that the Aryans were the
tamers of the horse which revolutionized warfare in
ancient days, and caused great empires to be overthrown
and new empires to be formed. When the Aryans
entered India they had chariots and swift steeds.</p>

<p>There is no general agreement as to the date of
settlement in the Punjab. Some authorities favour 2000
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, others 1700 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>; Professor Macdonell still adheres
to 1200 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span><a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> It is possible that the infusion was at first
a gradual one, and that it was propelled by successive
folk-waves. The period from the earliest migrations
until about 800 or 700 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> is usually referred to as the
Vedic Age, during which the Vedas, or more particularly
the invocatory hymns to the deities, were composed and
compiled. At the close of this Age the area of Aryan
control had extended eastward as far as the upper reaches
of the Jumna and Ganges rivers. A number of tribal
states or communities are referred to in the hymns.</p>

<p>It is of importance to note that the social and religious
organization of the Vedic Aryans was based upon the principle
of &#8220;father right&#8221;, as contrasted with the principle
of &#8220;mother right&#8221;, recognized by representative
communities of the Brown race.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span></p>
<p>Like the Alpine and Mongoloid peoples, the Vedic
Aryans were a patriarchal people, mainly pastoral but
with some knowledge of agriculture. They worshipped
gods chiefly: their goddesses were vague and shadowy:
their earth goddess Prithivi was not a Great Mother in
the Egyptian and early European sense; her husband was
the sky-god Dyaus.</p>

<p>In Egypt the sky was symbolized as the goddess Nut,
and the earth as the god Seb, but the Libyans had an
earth-goddess Neith. The &#8220;Queen of Heaven&#8221; was a
Babylonian and Assyrian deity. If the Brown race predominated
in the Aryan blend during the Vedic Age, we
should have found the Great Mother more in prominence.</p>

<p>The principal Aryan deities were Indra, god of
thunder, and Agni, god of fire, to whom the greater
number of hymns were addressed. From the earliest
times, however, Aryan religion was of complex character.
We can trace at least two sources of cultural
influence from the earlier Iranian period.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The hymns
bear evidence of the declining splendour of the sublime
deities Varuna and Mitra (Mithra). It is possible that
the conflicts to which references are made in some of the
hymns were not unconnected with racial or tribal religious
rivalries.</p>

<p>Indra, as we show (<a href="#CHAPTER_I_Indra_King_of_the_Gods">Chapter I</a>), bears resemblances to
other &#8220;hammer gods&#8221;. He is the Indian Thor, the
angry giant-killer, the god of war and conquests. That
his name even did not originate in India is made evident
by an inscription at Boghaz Köi, in Asia Minor, referring
to a peace treaty between the kings of the Hittites and
Mitanni. Professor Hugo Winckler has deciphered from
this important survival of antiquity &#8220;In-da-ra&#8221; as a Mitanni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span>
deity who was associated with Varuna, Mitra, and
Nasatya.</p>

<p>No evidence has yet been forthcoming to indicate any
connection between the Aryans in Mitanni and the early
settlers in India. It would appear, however, that the two
migrations represented by the widely separated areas of
Aryan control, radiated from a centre where the gods
Indra, Varuna, and Mitra were grouped in the official
religion. The folk-wave which pressed towards the
Punjab gave recognition to Agni, possibly as a result
of contact, or, more probably, fusion with a tribe of
specialized fire-worshippers.</p>

<p>If we separate the Indra from the Agni, cremating
worshippers, it will be of interest to follow the ethnic
clue which is thus suggested. Modern-day Hindus burn
their dead in accordance with the religious practice of the
Agni worshippers in the Vedic Age. It is doubtful, however,
if all the Aryan invaders practised cremation. There
are references to burial in the &#8220;house of clay&#8221;, and Yama,
god of the dead, was adored as the first man who explored
the path to the &#8220;Land of the Pitris&#8221; (Fathers) which lay
across the mountains. Professor Oldenberg considers that
these burials referred to the disposal of the bones and ashes
of the dead.</p>

<p>Professor Macdonell and Dr. Keith, however, do not
share Professor Oldenberg's view in this connection.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
They hold that the epithet <i>Agni-dagdhah</i>, &#8220;burnt with
fire&#8221;, &#8220;applies to the dead who were burned on the
funeral pyre&#8221;; the other custom being burial&mdash;<i>An-agni-dagdhah</i>,
&#8220;not burnt with fire&#8221;. They also refer to
<i>Paroptah</i>, &#8220;casting out&#8221;, and <i>Uddhitah</i>, &#8220;Exposure of
the dead&#8221;, which are expressions of doubtful meaning.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[Pg xxxiii]</a></span> These authorities add: &#8220;Burial was clearly not rare in
the Rigvedic period: a whole hymn (x, 18) describes the
ritual attending it. The dead man was buried apparently
in full attire, with his bow in his hand, and probably at
one time his wife was immolated to accompany him....
But in the Vedic period both customs appear in a modified
form: the son takes the bow from the hand of the
dead man, and the widow is led away from her dead
husband by his brother or nearest kinsman. A stone is
set up between the dead and the living to separate them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Persian fire-worshippers, on the other hand, did
not cremate their dead, but exposed them on &#8220;towers of
silence&#8221; to be devoured by vultures, like their modern-day
representatives the Parsees, who migrated into India
after displacement by the Mohammedans. In Persia the
sacred fire was called Atar,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and was identified with the
supreme deity Ahura-Mazda (Ormuzd).</p>

<p>Agni of the Vedic Age is the messenger between gods
and men; he conducts the deities to the sacrifice and the
souls of the cremated dead to Paradise; he is also the
twin brother of Indra.</p>

<p>Now, it is of interest to note, in considering the racial
significance of burial rites, that cremation was not practised
by the western representatives of the Brown race. In
pre-Dynastic Egypt the dead were interred as in Babylon,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
with food vessels, &amp;c. Neolithic man in Europe also
favoured crouched burials, and this practice obtained all
through the Bronze Age.</p>

<p>The Buriats, who are Mongols dwelling in the vicinity
of Lake Baikal, still perpetuate ancient customs, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span>resemble those of the Vedic Aryans, for they not only
practise cremation but also sacrifice the horse (see
<a href="#CHAPTER_V_Social_and_Religious_Developments_of_the_Vedic_Age">Chap. V</a>). In his important study of this remarkable
people, Mr. Curtin says:<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> &#8220;The Buriats usually burn
their dead; occasionally, however, there is what is called
a &#8216;Russian burial&#8217;, that is, the body is placed in a coffin
and the coffin is put in the ground. But generally if a
man dies in the Autumn or the Winter his body is placed
on a sled and drawn by the horse which he valued most
to some secluded place in the forest. There a sort of
house is built of fallen trees and boughs, the body is
placed inside the house, and the building is then surrounded
with two or three walls of logs so that no
wolf or other animal can get into it.&#8221; The horse is
afterwards slain. &#8220;If other persons die during the
winter their bodies are carried to the same house. In
this lonely silent place in the forest they rest through the
days and nights until the first cuckoo calls, about the ninth
of May. Then relatives and friends assemble, and without
opening the house burn it to the ground. Persons
who die afterwards and during the Summer months are
carried to the forest, placed on a funeral pile, and burned
immediately. The horse is killed just as in the first instance.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the dead are buried without being burned, the
corpse is either carried on a wagon, or it is placed upright
in front of a living man on horseback so as to ride to its
last resting place. The saddle is broken up and laid at
the bottom of the grave, while the body is turned to face
the south-east. In this case they also sacrifice the horse
which is believed to have &#8220;gone to his master, ready for
use&#8221;.</p>

<p>Cremation spread throughout Europe, as we have said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span>
in the Bronze Age. It was not practised by the early folk-waves
of the Alpine race which, according to Mosso,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
began to arrive after copper came into use. The two
European Bronze Age burial customs, associated with
urns of the &#8220;food vessel&#8221; and &#8220;drinking cup&#8221; types,
have no connection with the practice of burning the dead.
The Archæological Ages have not necessarily an ethnic
significance. Ripley is of opinion, however, that the
practice of cremation indicates a definite racial infusion,
but unfortunately it has destroyed the very evidence, of
which we are most in need, to solve the problem. It is
impossible to say whether the cremated dead were &#8220;broad
heads&#8221; or &#8220;long heads&#8221;.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Sophus Müller of Copenhagen is of opinion that
cremation was not practised long before the year 1000 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
though it appeared earlier in the south of Europe than in
the north. On both points Professor Ridgeway of Cambridge
agrees with him.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>The migration of the cremating people through Europe
was westward and southward and northward; they even
swept through the British Isles as far north as Orkney.
They are usually referred to by archæologists as &#8220;Aryans&#8221;;
some identify them with the mysterious Celts, whom the
French, however, prefer to associate, as we have said, with
the Alpine &#8220;broad heads&#8221; especially as this type bulks
among the Bretons and the hillmen of France. We must
be careful, however, to distinguish between the Aryans and
Celts of the philologists and archæologists.</p>

<p>It may be that these invaders were not a race in the
proper sense, but a military confederacy which maintained
a religious organization formulated in some unknown area
where they existed for a time as a nation. The Normans
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span>who invaded these islands were Scandinavians<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>; they settled
in France, intermarried with the French, and found allies
among the Breton chiefs. It is possible that the cremating
people similarly formed military aristocracies when they
settled in Hindustan, Mitanni, and in certain other European
areas. &#8220;Nothing is commoner in the history of
migratory peoples,&#8221; says Professor Myres,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> &#8220;than to find
a very small leaven of energetic intruders ruling and organizing
large native populations, without either learning
their subjects' language or imposing their own till considerably
later, if at all.&#8221; The archæological evidence in this
connection is of particular value. At a famous site near
Salzburg, in upper Austria, over a thousand Bronze Age
graves were discovered, just over half of which contained
unburnt burials. Both methods of interment were contemporary
in this district, &#8220;but it was noticed that the
cremated burials were those of the wealthier class, or of
the dominant race.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> We find also that at Hallstatt &#8220;the
bodies of the wealthier class were reduced to ashes&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> In
some districts the older people may have maintained their
supremacy. At Watsch and St. Margaret in Carniola &#8220;a
similar blending of the two rites was observed ... the unburnt
burials being the richer and more numerous&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The
descent of the Achaens into Greece occurred at a date
earlier than the rise of the great Hallstatt civilization.
According to Homeric evidence they burned their dead;
&#8220;though the body of Patroklos was cremated,&#8221; however,
&#8220;the lords of Mycenae were interred unburnt in richly
furnished graves&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> In Britain the cremating people
mingled with their predecessors perhaps more intimately
than in other areas where there were large states to conquer. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[Pg xxxvii]</a></span>
A characteristic find on Acklam Wold, Yorkshire,
may be referred to. In this grave &#8220;a pile of burnt bones
was in close contact with the legs of a skeleton buried in
the usual contracted position, and they seemed to have
been deposited while yet hot, for the knees of the skeleton
were completely charred. It has been suggested in cases
like this, or where an unburnt body is surrounded by a
ring of urn burials, the entire skeleton may be those of
chiefs or heads of families, and the burnt bones those of
slaves, or even wives, sacrificed at the funeral. The practice
of suttee (sati) in Europe rests indeed on the authority
of Julius Cæsar, who represents such religious suicides
as having, at no remote period from his own, formed a
part of the funeral rites of the Gaulish chiefs; and also
states that the relatives of a deceased chieftain accused his
wives of being accessory to his death, and often tortured
them to death on that account.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> If this is the explanation,
the cremating invaders constituted the lower classes in Gaul
and Britain, which is doubtful. The practice of burning
erring wives, however, apparently prevailed among the
Mediterranean peoples. In an Egyptian folk-tale a
Pharaoh ordered a faithless wife of a scribe to be burned
at the stake.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> One of the Ossianic folk tales of Scotland
relates that Grainne, wife of Finn-mac-Coul, who eloped
with Diarmid, was similarly dealt with.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The bulk of the
archæological evidence seems to point to the invaders, who
are usually referred to as &#8220;Aryans&#8221; having introduced the
cremation ceremony into Europe. Whence came they?
The problem is greatly complicated by the evidence from
Palestine, where cremation was practised by the hewers
of the great artificial caves which were constructed about
3000 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span><a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> As cremation did not begin in Crete, however, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[Pg xxxviii]</a></span>
until the end of period referred to as &#8220;Late Minoan
Third&#8221; (1450-1200 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>)<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> it may be that the Palestinian
burials are much later than the construction of the caves.</p>

<p>It seems reasonable to suppose that the cremation rite
originated among a nomadic people. The spirits of the
dead were got rid of by burning the body: they departed,
like the spirit of Patroklos, after they had received their
&#8220;meed of fire&#8221;. Burial sites were previously regarded as
sacred because they were haunted by the spirits of ancestors
(the Indian <i>Pitris</i> = &#8220;fathers&#8221;). A people who burned their
dead, and were therefore not bound by attachment to a
tribal holy place haunted by spirits, were certainly free to
wander. The spirits were transferred by fire to an organized
Hades, which appears to have been conceived of
by a people who had already attained to a certain social
organization and were therefore capable of governing the
communities which they subdued. When they mingled
with peoples practising other rites and professing different
religious beliefs, however, the process of racial fusion must
have been accompanied by a fusion of beliefs. Ultimately
the burial customs of the subject race might prevail. At
any rate, this appears to have been the case in Britain, where,
prior to the Roman Age, the early people achieved apparently
an intellectual conquest of their conquerors; the
practice of the cremation rite entirely vanished.</p>

<p>We have gone far afield to find a clue to assist towards
the solution of the Aryan problem in India. The evidence
accumulated is certainly suggestive, and shows that the
conclusions of the early philologists have been narrow in
the extreme. If the long-headed Kurds are, as Ripley
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[Pg xxxix]</a></span>believes, the descendants of the Mitanni raiders, then the
Aryans of history must be included in the Brown race.
As, however, cremation was not practised by the Berbers,
the Babylonians, the early Cretans, or other representatives
of the ancient brunet dolichocephalic peoples, it may
be that the custom, which still lingers among the Mongolian
Buriats, was not in the narrow sense of Aryan
origin. It may have been first practised among an unknown
tribe of fire-worshippers, who came under the
influence of a great teacher like Zoroaster. We cannot
overlook in this connection the possibility of an individual
origin for a new and revolutionary system of religious doctrines.
Buddhism, for instance, originated with Buddha.</p>

<p>As we have said, the Vedic religion of the Aryans in
India was characterized by the worship of male deities,
the goddesses being of secondary and even slight importance.
A religious revolution, however, occurred
during the second or Brahmanical Age&mdash;the age of
priestly ascendancy. Fresh invasions had taken place
and the Aryans were divided into tribal groups of Westerners
and Easterners, on either side of a central power
in Madhyadesa, the &#8220;Middle Country&#8221; which extended
between the upper reaches of the Saraswati and the
Ganges and the Jumna rivers. The Westerners included
the peoples of the Punjab and the north-western frontier,
and the Easterners the kingdoms of Kasi (Benares) and
Maghadha as well as Kosala and Videha, which figure
prominently in the <i>Ramáyana</i> epic, where the kings are
referred to as being of the &#8220;Solar race&#8221;. The Middle
Kingdom was the centre of Brahmanical culture and influence:
it was controlled by those federated tribes, the
Kuru Panchalas, with whom were fused the Bháratas of
the &#8220;Lunar race&#8221;. It is believed that the military
aristocracy of the &#8220;Middle Country&#8221; were late comers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[Pg xl]</a></span>
who arrived by a new route and thrust themselves between
the groups of early settlers.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The Bharatas worshipped
a goddess Bharati who was associated with the
Saraswati river on the banks of which the tribe had for
a period been located. Saraswati became the wife of
Brahma, the supreme god, and it would seem that she
had a tribal significance.</p>

<p>If the Bharatas of the &#8220;Lunar race&#8221; worshipped the
moon and rivers, it is possible that they belonged to the
Brown race. The folk-religion of the tribe would be
perpetuated by the people even although their priests became
speculative thinkers like the unknown authors of the
<i>Upanishads</i>. It is significant to note, therefore, that the
goddesses ultimately came into as great prominence in
India as in Egypt. This change took place during the
obscure period prior to the revival of Brahmanism. In
the sixth century before the Christian era Buddhism had
origin, partly as a revolt of the Kshatriya (aristocratic)
class against priestly ascendancy, and the new faith spread
eastward where Brahmanic influence was least pronounced.
When the influence of Buddhism declined, the Pantheon
is found to have been revolutionized and rendered
thoroughly Mediterranean in character. The Vedic gods
had in the interval suffered eclipse; they were subject to
the greater personal gods Brahma, with Vishnu and Shiva,
each of whom had a goddess for wife. Brahma, as we
have said, had associated with him the river deity Saraswati
of the Bharatas; the earth goddess, Lakshmi, was the
wife of Vishnu; she rose, however, from the Ocean of
Milk. But the most distinctive and even most primitive
goddesses were linked with Shiva, the Destroyer. The
goddess Durga rivalled Indra as a deity of war. Kali,
another form of Durga, was as vengeful and bloodthirsty
as the Scottish Cailleach, or the Egyptian Hathor, who, as
the earlier Sekhet, rejoiced in accomplishing the slaughter
of the enemies of Ra.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Kali, as we shall see (<a href="#CHAPTER_VIII_Divinities_of_the_Epic_Period">Chapter VIII</a>)
replaced the Vedic king of the gods as a successful demon
slayer. As the Egyptian Ra went forth to restrain Hathor,
so did Shiva hasten to the battlefield, flooded by gore, to
prevail upon his spouse Kali to spare the remnant of her
enemies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[Pg xli]</a></span></p>

<p>The rise of the goddesses may have been due in part
to the influence of Dravidian folk-religion. This does
not, however, vitiate the theory that moon, water, and
earth worship was not unconnected with the ascendancy
of the Brown race in India. The Dravidian brunet long
heads were, as we have said, probably represented in the
pre-Aryan, as well as the post-Vedic folk-waves, which
mingled with pre-Dravidian stocks. Mr. Crooke inclines
to the view that the Aryan conquest was more moral and
intellectual than racial.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The decline of the patriarchal
religion of the Vedic military aristocracy may thus be accounted
for; the religious practices of the earlier people
might ultimately have attained prominence in fusion with
imported ideas. If the Aryan racial type was distinctive,
as it appears to have been, in colour at any rate, the predominant
people who flourished when the hymns were
composed, may have greatly declined in numbers owing
to the ravages of disease which in every new country
eliminates the unfit in the process of time. Even if
Aryan conquest was more racial in character than Mr.
Crooke will allow, the physical phenomena of the present
day can be accounted for in this way, due allowance being
made, of course, for the crossment of types. In all
countries which have sustained the shock of invasion, the
tendency to revert to the aboriginal type is very marked.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[Pg xlii]</a></span>At any rate, this is the case in Egypt and Crete as present-day
evidence shows. In Great Britain, which was invaded
by the broad heads of the Bronze Age, the long-headed
type is once again in the majority; a not inconsiderable
proportion of our people show Stone Age (Mediterranean)
physical characteristics.</p>

<p>In this connection it is of interest to refer to immemorial
beliefs and customs which survive in representative
districts in Britain and India where what may be called
pre-Aryan influences are most pronounced. A people may
change their weapons and their language time and again,
and yet retain ancient modes of thought. In Devon,
which the philologists claim to be largely Celtic like
Cornwall, the folk-lore shows marked affinities with that
of Ireland, Wales, and Scotland, suggesting the survival
of ancient Mediterranean racial influence, for much of what
we call Celtic links with what belongs to ancient Greece
and the Egyptian Delta. Mr. Gomme has shown<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> in an
interesting summary of recorded folk-practices that the
&#8220;ram feast&#8221; of Devon resembles closely in essential details
similar ceremonies in ancient Greece and modern
India. At the beginning of May the people of Devon
were wont to sacrifice a ram lamb to the deity of waters.
The animal was tied to a pillar, its throat was cut, and
young men scrambled to obtain pieces of its flesh for girls.
The devourer was assured of good luck during the year.
After the ceremony, dancing, wrestling, and drinking were
indulged in. A comparison is drawn between this and
similar rites among the ancient Semites and ancient Greeks.
In India a Dravidian Paria acts as the temporary village
priest. He uses a whip like the &#8220;gad whip&#8221; in Lincolnshire,
and kills the lamb by tearing its throat with his
teeth. A scramble takes place for the flesh, the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[Pg xliii]</a></span>
circulate the village, as some communities in our own
country still perpetuate the ceremony of &#8220;riding the
marches&#8221; of ancient burghs; then universal licence prevails.
Similarly law was suspended at the ancient Scottish
Hallowe'en celebrations; in some districts even in our
own day Hallowe'en and New Year practical jokes and
rowdyism is still prevalent. Herodotus refers to the
universal licence and debauchery which characterized the
Isis festival in Egypt.</p>

<p>A remarkable feature of post-Vedic religion in ancient
India is the prominence given to the doctrine of metempsychosis
(transmigration of souls) and the conception
of the yugas or ages of the universe.</p>

<p>In the <i>Rigveda</i> the soul of the dead proceeds at once,
or at any rate after burial, towards the next world. In
one passage only is it spoken of &#8220;as departing to the
waters or the plants&#8221;, and this reference, Professor Macdonell
suggests,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> &#8220;may contain the germs of the theory&#8221;
of transmigration. In the speculative prose treatises, the
<i>Upanishads</i>, which were composed in the Middle Country,
the doctrine of metempsychosis is fully expounded. It
does not follow, however, that it originated in India although
it may have obtained there unrecognized by the
priestly poets who composed the hymns to the deities,
long before it became an essential tenet of orthodox or
official religion. Other representative communities of the
Brown race professed this doctrine which appears to have
evolved from the vague belief shared by more than one
primitive race, that the souls of the dead, and especially
of dead children, were ever on the outlook for suitable
mothers. Even in Central Australia a particular tribe has
perpetuated &#8220;the germs of the theory&#8221;, which may also
be traced in the widespread custom of visiting standing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[Pg xliv]</a></span>stones at a certain phase of the moon to perform a ceremony
so that offspring may be obtained. The Upanishadic
doctrine of metempsychosis is less likely to have
been so much coincidental as racial when we find that it
is restricted to those areas where definite racial influences
must have been at work. The Greeks believed in transmigration.
So did also a section of the Egyptian people
as Herodotus has stated and as is proved by references
in folk-tales, temple chants and inscriptions.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> As we show
(<a href="#CHAPTER_VI_Mysteries_of_Creation">Chapter VI</a>), the Irish conception closely resembled the
Indian, and it also obtained among the Gauls. There is
no trace, however, that the Teutonic peoples were acquainted
with the fully developed doctrine of metempsychosis;
the souls of the dead departed immediately
to Valhal, Hela, or the loathsome Nifelhel.</p>

<p>The doctrine of the world's ages is common to the
Indian, Greek, and Irish mythologies, but is not found
in Teutonic mythology either.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> There are indications
that it may have at one time obtained in Egypt, for there
was an Age of Ra, then a deluge, an Age of Osiris, an
Age of Set, &amp;c.; but the doctrine, like other conceptions
in Egypt, probably suffered from the process of priestly
transformation in the interests of sectarian propaganda.</p>

<p>In India the ages are called the yugas, and this term
has a totally different meaning in Vedic and Upanishadic
times. Evidently the Bharata invasion and the establishment
of the middle country power of their allies, the
Kuru-Panchalas, was not unconnected with the introduction
of the doctrines of metempsychosis and the
yugas, and the prominence subsequently given to the
worship of female deities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[Pg xlv]</a></span></p>

<p>If this theory can be established, we are confronted
by an extremely interesting problem. It would appear
that the mythology of the Vedic period bears a close
resemblance to Teutonic, while that of the post-Vedic
period connects more intimately with Greek, Celtic, and
Egyptian. Assuming that the Vedic people were influenced
by what we recognize as Teutonic modes of
thought, do we find here proof that the Aryans came
from Europe? In <a href="#CHAPTER_II_The_Great_Vedic_Deities">Chapter II</a> it is shown that the Norse
Heimdal displays points of resemblance to Agni. The
former, however, has been developed almost beyond recognition
as a fire god, and it is evident that we find him
in northern Europe in his latest and most picturesque
form. On the other hand, there is no dubiety about the
origin of the Vedic Agni.</p>

<p>The evidence afforded by archæology is highly suggestive
in this connection. Scandinavia received its culture
from the south at a comparatively late period in the
Bronze Age, and it certainly exercised no intellectual
influence in Europe in earlier times. Bronze is, of
course, of less ethnic significance than beliefs, but it is
difficult to believe, at the same time, that an isolated and
poorly armed people could have imposed its intellectual
culture over a wide area without having received anything
in return. It is more probable that the northern
Germanic peoples were subjected to the same influences
which are traceable in their mythology and in the Vedic
hymns, from a common source, and there may be more
than mere mythology in the persistent tradition that the
ancestors of the Teutons immigrated from Asia led by
Odin. We need not assume that the movement was so
much a racial as a cultural one, which emanated from a
particular area where religious conceptions were influenced
by particular habits of life and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[Pg xlvi]</a></span> &#8220;immemorial modes of
thought&#8221;. Among the settled and agricultural peoples of
the Brown race, the development of religious ideas followed
different lines, and were similarly controlled by early ideas
which sprang from different habits and experiences.</p>

<p>In the opening chapters we present various phases
of Aryan life and religion in India, beginning with the
worship of Indra, and concluding with the early stages
of modern Hinduism. From the ancient tribal struggles
of the Middle Country accumulated the hero songs which
received epic treatment in the <i>Mahábhárata</i>, while the
traditions of the &#8220;Easterners&#8221; were enshrined in the
<i>Rámáyana</i>. Although neither of these great works can be
regarded as historical narratives, they contain a mass of
historical matter which throws much light on the habits
and customs and beliefs of the early peoples.</p>

<p>These epics were utilized by Brahmanical compilers
for purposes of religious propaganda, and survive to us
mainly as sacred books. In our pages we have given
prominence to the heroic narrative which remains embedded
in the mass of doctrinal treatises and mythological
interpolations. The miraculous element is somewhat
toned down in the accounts of conflicts, and the more
dramatic phases of the heroic stories are presented in as
full detail as space permits, so as to afford our readers
glimpses of ancient life in northern India at a time when
Vedic religion still held sway. This applies especially
to the <i>Mahábhárata</i>, the kernel of which, no doubt, contains
the hero songs of the Bharata and other tribes. The
mythical conflicts of the <i>Rámáyana</i> appeal less to western
minds than its purely human episodes. We cannot help
being impressed by the chivalrous character of the leading
heroes, the high sense of honour displayed by the princes,
and the obedience shown by sons to their parents. We
may weary of Rama's conflicts with giants and demons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[Pg xlvii]</a></span>
but will long remember him as the child who pronounced
his name as &#8220;'Ama&#8221; and cried for the moon, or sat on
his father's knee at meetings of the State Council. Our
interest will also abide with him as a lover and a faithful
husband who suffered wrong. His brothers are noble
and heroic characters, worthy of Shakespeare. But even
the Bard of Avon never depicted more wonderful and
fascinating women than the heroines of the <i>Mahábhárata</i>
and <i>Rámáyana</i>. Our gallery includes, among others, the
noble and self-sacrificing Savitri, who rescued her husband
from the clutches of death by exercise of her strong love
and devotion; the faithful and virtuous Sita, and the sorrowful
and constant Damayantí, and beautiful Shakuntalá.
In western literature romance usually ends with marriage;
in India the devotion of wives is of more account than
the yearnings of love-smitten Juliets on moonlight nights.</p>

<p>Another aspect of Sanskrit literature is the feeling of
the poets for Nature. These voluminous writers revelled
in the luxuriant loveliness and splendour of Indian forests,
and the charms of gleaming valleys and serene, snow-capped
mountains; even the gods loved to hear the hum
of insects and the songs of melodious birds, and, like
mortals, to gather flowers of sweet scents and brilliant
colours. Hundreds of songs were sung in praise of the
lotus blooms that gemmed the clear waters of lakes and
ponds, and Paradise was pictured as a jungle of beauty,
fanned by soft winds, radiant with blossoms, and ever
vocal with music and song. To illustrate this phase of
India's classic literature, we reproduce at length the representative
story of Nala with much of its poetic details.</p>

<p>The civilization revealed by the narrative poems was
of no mean order. The ancient Aryans were chivalrous
knights. No such barbaric incident occurs in the <i>Mahábhárata</i>
battles as when in the <i>Iliad</i> the victorious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[Pg xlviii]</a></span> Achilles drags behind his chariot the body of the slain
Hector. When Arjuna, the Indian Achilles, slays Karna,
the Indian Hector, he honours his fallen foe and performs
those rites at the funeral pyre which assures the dead
hero immortal bliss in Paradise. When, again, Arjuna
mortally wounds Bhishma, he procures water to quench
the thirst of his dying opponent. Even the villains are
not without their redeeming qualities. Duryodhana of the
<i>Mahábhárata</i>, who consents to the slaughter of his sleeping
rivals, dies with grief because the innocent children of his
enemies were slain. Rávana, the demon king of Ceylon,
touches us in the <i>Rámáyana</i> by his grief for his son, who
was slain fighting against Laksmana, brother of Rama.</p>

<p>To appreciate fully the sacred and romantic literature
of India, we should follow the advice of Robert Louis
Stevenson. &#8220;To learn aright from any teacher,&#8221; he
wrote, &#8220;we must first of all, like a historical artist, think
ourselves into sympathy with his position.&#8221; And if in
endeavouring to understand the religious conceptions of
the ancient forest sages, we, at times, find ourselves in difficulties,
it may be that &#8220;if a saying is hard to understand,
it is because we are thinking of something else&#8221;&mdash;we are
looking on India with European eyes and with European
prejudices. &#8220;There is always&#8221;, said Stevenson, &#8220;a ruling
spirit behind the code of rules, an attitude, a relation, a point
of the compass, in virtue of which we conform or dissent.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>We are confident that our readers who peruse with
sympathy and, we hope, with enjoyment, the chapters which
follow, will feel themselves drawn closer than hitherto to
the millions of our fellow subjects in the great dependency
of the British Empire, by whom Rama and Yudhishthira
are regarded as ideal types of strong manhood, and Savitri
and Sita as perfect women and exemplary lovers and wives.</p>

<p>The ancient Eur-Asian &#8220;hammer god&#8221;, bearing the
tribal name of Indra, accompanied the earliest invading
bands of hunting and pastoral Aryans, who hailed with
joy the &#8220;fresh woods and pastures new&#8221; of the Punjab,
the green country of &#8220;Five Rivers&#8221;. This deity of
wanderers and invaders was already of great antiquity and
wide distribution; his attributes were in accord with the
habits and ideals of his worshippers; they multiplied with
the discoveries of man and were ever influenced by the
conditions prevailing in new areas of localization. He
was the Thunderer who brought rain to quicken dried-up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
pasture lands; he was the god of fertility, and he became
the corn spirit; he was &#8220;the friend of man&#8221;; he was the
artisan of the Universe which he shaped with his hammer,
the dragon slayer, the giant killer, the slaughterer of
enemies, the god of war. His racial significance must
ever remain obscure. We cannot identify his original
home, or even fix with certainty the archæological period
in which he first took definite shape. It is possible that
he may have been invoked and propitiated by Neolithic,
or even by Palæolithic, flint knappers who struck fire
from stone long ere they suspected the existence of metal;
the primitive hunting and pastoral wanderers may have
conceived of a thunder deity engaged in splintering the
hills with his stone hammer, and fighting demons in the
rude manner in which they themselves contended against
beasts of prey. Memories of the Stone Age cling to the
hammer god. Indra's bolt was &#8220;the all-dreaded thunderstone&#8221;
of Shakespeare's lyric; until recently Palæolithic
and Neolithic artifacts were reputed to be &#8220;elf bolts&#8221;
and &#8220;thunder bolts&#8221; which fell from the sky; in Scandinavian
folklore &#8220;the flint hills&#8221; are the fragments of the
weapon wielded by the thunder giant Hrungner. The
bolt or hammer ultimately became an axe; and according
to the modern Greeks, lightning flashes are caused by the
blows of the &#8220;sky axe&#8221; (astropeléki); Scottish Gaelic
retains an immemorial reference to the &#8220;thunder ball&#8221;
(peleir-tarnainaich).</p>

<p>The hammer god's close association with hilly countries
suggests that he was first worshipped on the steppes and
then distributed by the nomads whose migrations were
propelled by changing climatic conditions. He is found
as far east as China, where, as P'an Ku, the dwarfish
&#8220;first man&#8221;, he smites primeval rocks with his thunder
hammer while engaged in the work of shaping the hills;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
he is found as far west as Scotland, where, as the hunting
giant Finn-mac-Coul, &#8220;in height sixty feet&#8221;, he strikes
with his hammer, &#8220;Ord na Feinne&#8221;, such mighty blows
on his shield that he is heard by his followers in Lochlann
(Scandinavia). From ancient Egypt come distant echoes
of the world artisan Ptah, now a dwarf and anon a giant,
who hammers out the copper sky, suggesting the presence
in Memphis of early Asian settlers at the very dawn of
history. In southern Europe the deity is Zeus-pater
(Jupiter), the sublime wielder of the thunderbolt; in
northern Europe he is lusty Thor, hurling Mjolner
through the air against Jotuns, or cleaving valleys with
it in the mountain range which he mistook for the giant
Skrymer. We find the hammer god as Tarku among the
Hittites; he is Indra in Mitanni as in the Punjab; he is
Rammon, or Adad, who is carried aloft in triumph by the
soldiers of Assur-banipal, the Assyrian Emperor; he is
remembered in Palestine by the wail of Naaman, who
cried: &#8220;When my master goeth into the house of Rimmon
to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow
myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself
in the house of Rimmon, the Lord pardon thy servant
in this thing....&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The thunder god is also known in
Babylon, which received many of its settlers from the hills
of Elam and where Kassites, associated with Aryans,
established a dynasty after successful invasion, prior to
the discovery of the Punjab. The authorities are agreed
that Aryan culture shows traces of Babylonian influence;
it does not follow, however, that Indra is of Babylonian
origin.</p>

<p>But although his name, which has been deciphered as
&#8220;In-da-ra&#8221; at Boghaz-Köi in Asia Minor, may belong to
the early Iranian period, the Vedic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> &#8220;King of the gods&#8221;
assumed a distinctly Indian character after localization in
the land of the &#8220;Five Rivers&#8221;; he ultimately stepped
from his chariot, drawn by the steeds of the Aryan horse
tamers, and mounted an elephant; his Heaven, called
Swarga, which is situated on the summit of Mount Meru,
eclipses Olympus and Valhal by reason of its dazzling
Oriental splendour; his combats are reflections of the
natural phenomena of Hindustan.</p>

<p>When the hot Indian summer draws to a close, the
whole land is parched and athirst for rain; rivers are low
and many hill streams have dried up; man and beast
are weary and await release in the breathless enervating
atmosphere; they are even threatened by famine. Then
dense masses of cloud gather in the sky; the tempest
bellows, lightnings flash and thunder peals angrily and
loud; rain descends in a deluge; once again torrents
pour down from the hills and rivers become swollen and
turgid. Indra has waged his battle with the Drought
Demons, broken down their fortress walls, and released
the imprisoned cow-clouds which give nourishment to his
human &#8220;friends&#8221;; the withered pastures become green
with generous and rapid growth, and the rice harvest
follows.</p>

<p>According to Vedic myth, Indra achieved his first
great victory immediately after birth. Vritra, &#8220;the encompasser&#8221;,
the Demon of Drought, was holding captive
in his mountain fortress the cloud-cattle which he had
harried in the approved manner of the Aryan raiders.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
Mankind entreated the aid of the gods, &#8220;the shining
ones, the world guardians&#8221;:</p>

<p>Indra arose heroically to do battle for the sacrificers.
Impulsively he seized the nectar of the gods, called Soma,
and drank a deep draught of that intoxicating juice.
Then he snatched up his thunderstone which had been
fashioned by the divine artisan Twashtri, who resembles the
Germanic Mimer, the &#8220;wonder smith&#8221;. His &#8220;favourite
bays&#8221;, named the Bold and the Brown, were yoked in
his golden chariot by his attendants and followers, the
youthful Maruts.</p>

<p>Now, at the very beginning, Indra, the golden child,
became the king of the three worlds. He it was who
gave the air of life; he gave strength also. All the shining
gods revered him and obeyed his commands. &#8220;His
shadow is immortality; his shadow is death.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Maruts, the sons of red Rudra, were the spirits
of tempest and thunder. To each of their chariots were
yoked two spotted deer and one swift-footed, never-wearying
red deer as leader. They were stalwart and
courageous youths, &#8220;full of terrible designs like to
giants&#8221;; on their heads were golden helmets and they
had golden breastplates, and wore bright skins on their
shoulders; their ankles and arms were decked with golden
bracelets. The Maruts were always strongly armed with
bows and arrows and axes, and especially with gleaming
spears. All beings feared those &#8220;cloud shakers&#8221; when
they hastened forth with their lightning spears which
&#8220;shattered cattle like the thunderstone&#8221;; they were wont
to cleave cloud-rocks and drench the earth with quickening
showers.</p>

<p>When Indra drove forth to attack the Drought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Demon, the &#8220;hastening Maruts&#8221; followed him, shouting
with loud voices: in &#8220;a shower&#8221; were the Maruts &#8220;let
loose&#8221;; they dashed towards the imprisoned cows of the
clouds and &#8220;chased them aloft&#8221;.</p>

<p>The dragon Vritra roared when Indra drew nigh;
whereat heaven shook and the gods retreated. Mother
Earth, the goddess Prithivi (prit´hi-vee), was troubled
regarding her golden son. But Indra advanced boldly
with the roaring Maruts; he was inspired by the hymns
of the priests; he had drunken deeply of Soma; he was
strengthened by the sacrifices offered on earth's altars;
and he wielded the thunderstone.</p>

<p>The Drought Demon deemed itself invulnerable, but
Indra cast his weapon and soon discovered the vulnerable
parts of its writhing body. He slew the monster; it lay
prone before him; the torrents burst forth and carried it
away to the sea of eternal darkness. Then Indra rejoiced
and cried out:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I have slain Vritra, O ye hast'ning Maruts;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have grown mighty through my own great vigour;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am the hurler of the bolt of Thunder&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For man flow freely now the gleaming waters.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On earth the worshippers of the god were made glad;
the Rishi hymned his praises:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I will extol the manly deeds of Indra:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first was when the Thunder stone he wielded<br /></span>

</div>
<div class="poematrib">&mdash;<i>Rigveda</i>, i. 32.</div>
</div>

<p>A post-Vedic version of the encounter between Indra
and the demon Vritra is given in the &#8220;Vana Parva&#8221; section
of <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>. Although it is coloured by the change
which, in the process of time, passed over the religious
beliefs of the Aryans, it retains some features of the
original myth which are absent in the Vedic hymns.
It should be understood that, at the period referred to, the
belief obtained that the gods derived their powers from
the saintly Rishis,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> who fed them with sacrifices and underwent
terrible penances, which enabled them to support or
destroy the Universe at will.</p>

<p>It is related that in the Krita Age (the first Age of
the Universe) a host of D&#257;n&#257;vas (giants and demons)
were so strongly armed that they were invincible in
battle. They selected the dragon Vritra as their leader,
and waged war against the gods, whom they scattered in
all directions.</p>

<p>Realizing that they could not regain their power until
they accomplished the death of Vritra, the Celestials
appeared before their Grandsire, the Supreme Being,
Brahma, the incarnation of the Soul of the Universe.
Brahma instructed them to obtain the bones of a Rishi
named Dadhicha, from which to construct a demon-slaying
weapon. So the gods visited the Rishi and bowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
down before him, and begged the boon according to
Brahma's advice.</p>

<p>Said Dadhicha: &#8220;O ye gods, I will renounce my
body for your benefit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the Rishi gave up his life, and from his bones
the artisan god, Twashtri, shaped Indra's great weapon,
which is called Vajra.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Twashtri spake to Indra and said: &#8220;With this, the
best of weapons, O exalted one, reduce that fierce foe of
the gods to ashes! And, having slain the foe, rule thou
happily the entire domain of heaven, O chief of the
celestials, with those that follow thee.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Then Indra led the gods against the mighty host.
They found that Vritra was surrounded by dreaded
Danavas, who resembled mountain peaks. A terrible
conflict was waged, but once again the gods were put
to flight. Then Indra saw Vritra growing bolder, and
he became dejected. But the Supreme Being protected
him and the gods endowed him with their strength, so
that he became mightier than before. Thereupon Vritra
was enraged, and roared loudly and fiercely, so that the
heavens shook and the earth trembled with fear. Deeply
agitated, Indra flung his divine weapon, which slew the
leader of the Danavas. But Indra, thinking the demon
was still alive, fled from the field in terror to seek shelter
in a lake. The Celestials, however, perceived that Vritra
had been slain, and they rejoiced greatly and shouted the
praises of Indra. Then, rallying once more, the gods
attacked the panic-stricken Danavas, who turned and fled
to the depths of ocean. There in the fathomless darkness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>they assembled together, and began to plot how
they would accomplish the destruction of the three
worlds.<a name="FNanchor_47_47_1" id="FNanchor_47_47_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>At length the dread conspirators resolved to destroy
all the Rishis who were possessed of knowledge and
ascetic virtue, because the world was supported by them.
So they made the ocean their abode, raising billows high
as hills for their protection, and they began to issue forth
from their fortress to make attacks on the mighty saints.</p>

<p>In the Babylonian Story of Creation the female dragon
Tiawath (Tiamat), whose name signifies &#8220;the sea&#8221;,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> desired
to possess the world, and plotted against the gods
with her horde of giant serpents, &#8220;raging dogs, scorpion
men, fish men, and other terrible beings&#8221;. The gods
then selected Belus (Bel-Merodach) as their leader, and
proclaimed him their king. He slew Tiawath and covered
the heavens with one part of her body, and fashioned the
earth with the other half. Then he set the moon and
the stars in the sky, and afterwards created man: &#8220;he
divided the darkness, separated the heavens from the
earth, and reduced the universe to order&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The sun
was the offspring of the moon.</p>

<p>The Indian Vedic and Epic dragon-slaying stories
have evidently no connection, however, with a lost
Creation myth. It is possible that they are part of the
floating material from which Babylonian mythology was
framed. At the same time Babylonian influences may
not have been absent in the post-Vedic Age. Indra bears
points of resemblance to Bel-Merodach, but he is not a
Creator in the sublime sense; he is rather an artisan god
like the Chinese P'an Ku, the lonely hammerman, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>the Egyptian Ptah, who acquired a potter's wheel, in
addition to his hammer, in the Nile valley.</p>

<p>Indra fashioned the universe in the simple manner
that the early Aryans built their wooden houses.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> How
he obtained the requisite material puzzled the Vedic
poets. It may be that there was a World Tree, however,
like the great ash Ygdrasil of Teutonic mythology.
After measuring space with the sun, Indra set up four
corner posts and constructed the world walls; the roof
was the cloud-thatched sky. The wide doors of the
world opened to the east, and every morning they were
opened to admit the sun, which Indra flung at evening
into the darkness as a Neolithic man may have flung out
a house torch. These doors are the &#8220;gates&#8221;, celebrated
in the Vedic hymns, through which the gods entered to
partake of the sacrifices and libations. Indra, who is
called &#8220;an accomplished artisan&#8221;, is lauded as the god
who &#8220;firmly secured the dominion of air in the frame of
heaven and earth&#8221;. In another hymn it is told: &#8220;Indra
measured six broad spaces, from which no existing thing
is excluded: he it is who made the wide expanse of earth
and the lofty dome of the sky, even he&#8221;. (V. i, 47·3, 4.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>In the work of shaping the universe Indra is assisted
by the shadowy deities Savitri, who merged with Surya,
the sun god, Brihaspati, &#8220;Lord of Prayer&#8221;, who merged
with Agni, god of fire, and Vishnu, god of grace. He
was also aided by the Ribhus, the artisans of the gods,
who dwelt in the region of mid-air. Their number is
given variously as three or the multiples of three; they
were the sons of Sudhanvan, who was apparently identical
with Indra, because &#8220;Indra is a Ribhu when he
confers gifts&#8221;; indeed, the artisans are referred to as
the children of the Thunder god. They make grass
and herbs, and also channels for streams. In some respects
they resemble the earth-gnomes, the Khnumu,
&#8220;the modellers&#8221;, the helpers of the Egyptian artisan god
Ptah, who shaped the world. &#8220;Countless little figures
of these gods are found in Egyptian tombs; for even as
once the Khnumu had helped in the making of the world,
so would they help to reconstruct in all its members the
body of the dead man in whose tomb they were laid.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
The Ribhus similarly renovated aged and decrepit parents;
&#8220;they reunited the old cow to the calf&#8221;; they are also
credited with having shaped the heavens and the earth,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
and with having fashioned the &#8220;cow of plenty&#8221;, and also
a man named Vibhvan.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>According to the <i>Oxford Dictionary</i>, they are &#8220;the three
genii of the seasons in Hindu mythology&#8221;. The Sanskrit
word &#8220;Ribhu&#8221; is sometimes compared with the Germanic
word &#8220;Elf&#8221;. Professor Macdonell considers it &#8220;likely
that the Ribhus were originally terrestrial or aerial elves&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
They are evidently of common origin with the Teutonic
elfin artisans who are associated with Thor, the Germanic
Indra.</p>

<p>The mother of the Ribhus was Saranyu, daughter of
Twashtri, &#8220;the Hindu Vulcan&#8221;, the &#8220;master workman&#8221;.
Twashtri forms the organism in maternal wombs and
supports the races of man.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> As we have seen, he was
the fashioner of Indra's thunderbolt: similarly the Teutonic
elfin artisan Sindre makes Thor's hammer.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>The two groups of Teutonic wonder-smiths were
rivals; so were the Ribhus and Twashtri. The elfin
artisans prove their skill in both cases by producing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>wonderful gifts for the gods. Loke acts as a mischief-making
spy in Germanic myth, and Dadyak in Indian,
and both lose their heads for wagers, but save them by
cunning.</p>

<p>The Ribhus had provided the Celestials with horses
and chariots, but Twashtri fashioned a wonderful bowl
which filled itself with Soma for the gods. In the contest
that ensued the Ribhus transformed the bowl into four
cups. &#8220;This bowl&#8221;, says Professor Macdonell, &#8220;perhaps
represents the moon, the four cups being its phases.&#8221;
One of the Ribhus was a famous archer, like the elfin
artisan Egil of Teutonic mythology.</p>

<p>The artisan of Babylonian mythology is Ea, father of
Bel-Merodach. He is &#8220;King of the abyss, creator of
everything, lord of all&#8221;. He was the god of artisans
in general, and is identified with the sea-deity of the
Persian Gulf&mdash;half-fish, half-man&mdash;who landed &#8220;during
the day to teach the inhabitants the building of houses
and temples, the gathering of fruits, and also geometry,
law and letters&#8221;. His pupils included &#8220;potters, blacksmiths,
sailors, stonecutters, gardeners, farmers, &amp;c.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>The Ribhus and Twashtri were the artisans of nature,
the spirits of growth, the genii of the seasons, the elves
of earth and air. Indra's close association with them
emphasizes his character as a god of fertility, who brought
the quickening rain, and as the corn god, and the rice
god. He was the son of Father Heaven and Mother
Earth, two vague deities who were never completely individualized,
but were never forgotten. Heaven was the
sky-god Dyaus-pita (from div = to shine), the Zeus pater
of the Greeks, Jupiter of the Romans, and Tivi<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> (later,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>Odin) of the Germanic peoples, whose wife was the
earth-goddess Jord, mother of Thor. The Hindu earth-mother
(Terra mater) was Prithivi. Dyaus is sometimes
referred to as a ruddy bull, whose bellowing is the
thunder; as the Night heaven he is depicted as a black
steed decked with pearls which are the stars; in one of
the Vedic hymns reference is made to his &#8220;thunderstone&#8221;.
Prithivi, who is sometimes symbolized as a cow,
is the source of all vegetation, the supporter of earth, the
female principle. She never assumes the importance of
the Assyrian Ishtar, or the north Egyptian &#8220;earth-mother&#8221;
Neith, or the &#8220;earth-mothers&#8221; of Europe. The Vedic
Aryans were Great Father worshippers rather than Great
Mother worshippers: their female deities were Night,
Dawn, Earth, and the Rivers, but they were not sharply
individualized until late; they are vague in the Vedas.</p>

<p>As the Greek Cronus (Roman Saturn) slew his father
Ur&#259;nus (Heaven), so did Indra slay his father Dyaus
(Heaven). His earth-mother addresses him, saying:
&#8220;Who has made thy mother a widow? Who has sought
to slay the sleeping and the waking? What deity has
been more gracious than thou, since thou hast slain thy
father, having seized him by the foot?&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>The Indian father-slaying myth appears to be connected
with the doctrine of reincarnation. In the <i>Laws
of Manu</i> it is stated that &#8220;the husband, after conception
by his wife, becomes an embryo and is born again of
her; for that is the wifehood of a wife, that he is born
again by her&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> In the famous story of Shakunt&#259;l&#257;, the
husband is similarly referred to as the son of his wife,
the son being a reincarnation of the father.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> This belief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>resembles the Egyptian conception which is summed up
in the phrase &#8220;husband of his mother&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>At the barley harvest in spring and the rice harvest
in autumn offerings were made to the gods. A sacrificial
cake of the new barley or rice was offered to Indra and
Agni, a mess of old grain boiled and mixed with milk
and water was given to the other gods, and a cake was
also offered to Father Heaven and Mother Earth in
which clarified butter was an important ingredient; or the
offering might consist entirely of butter, because &#8220;clarified
butter is manifestly the sap of these two, Heaven
and Earth; ... he (the offerer) therefore gladdens these
two with their own sap or essence&#8221;.</p>

<p>The reason for this harvest offering is explained as
follows: The gods and the demons contended for supremacy.
It chanced that the demons defiled, partly by
magic and partly by poison, the plants used by men and
beasts, hoping thus to overcome the gods. Men ceased
to eat and the beasts stopped grazing; all creatures were
about to perish because of the famine.</p>

<p>Said the gods: &#8220;Let us rid the plants of this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they offered sacrifices and &#8220;accomplished all
that they wanted to accomplish, and so did the Rishis&#8221;.</p>

<p>A dispute then arose among the gods as to who
should partake of the offerings of the firstfruits&mdash;that
is, of the new plants which replaced those the demons
had poisoned. It was decided to run a race to settle the
matter. Indra and Agni won the race and were therefore
awarded the cake. These two gods were divine
Kshatriyas (noblemen), the others were &#8220;common people&#8221;.
Whatever Kshatriyas conquer, the commoners are permitted
to share; therefore the other gods received the
mess of old grain.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>
<p>After the magic spell was removed from the plants
by the gods, men ate food and cattle grazed once again.
Ever afterwards, at the beginning of each harvest, the
first fruits were offered up to Indra and Agni. The fee
of the priest was the first-born calf &#8220;for that is, as it
were, the firstfruits of the cattle&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>The popular Thunder god of the Vedic period bears
a close resemblance to the hard-drinking, kindly, and
impulsive Thor, the Teutonic god of few words and
mighty deeds, the constant &#8220;friend of man&#8221; and the
inveterate enemy of demons. In the hymns Indra is
pictured as a burly man, with &#8220;handsome, prominent
nose&#8221;, &#8220;good lips&#8221;, and &#8220;comely chin&#8221;; he is &#8220;long-necked,
big-bellied, strongly armed&#8221;, and has a weakness
for ornaments. He is much addicted to drinking &#8220;sweet,
intoxicating Soma&#8221;; he &#8220;fills his stomach&#8221;; he quaffs
&#8220;thirty bowls&#8221; at a single draught ere he hastens to
combat against &#8220;hostile air demons&#8221;. Sometimes he is
placed in a difficulty when two tribes of his worshippers
are in conflict: both cry to him for victory, but&mdash;</p>

<div class="poematrib"><i>Rigveda</i>, iv, 24. 2-6.</div>
</div>

<p>The Aryans, who were as notorious cattle lifters as
the Gauls and the Scottish Highlanders, were wont to
invoke the god ere they set out on a raid, chanting with
loud voices:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Indra, whose riches are boundless, O grant us<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thousands of beautiful cows and horses:<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>

<span class="i2">Thousands of beautiful cows and horses.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="poematrib"><i>Wilson's translation.</i></div>

<p>In other hymns the Thor-like character of Indra, the
war god, is naively depicted. A sceptic is supposed to
say: &#8220;Many men declare that there is no Indra. Who
ever saw him? Why should we adore him?&#8221;</p>

<p>The god makes answer: &#8220;O singer, I <i>am</i>: behold me!
I am here now, and I am greater than any living being.
I delight in the performance of holy rites. I am also
the Destroyer; I can hurl creation to ruin.&#8221; <i>Rigveda</i>,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>The human qualities of Indra are illustrated in epic
narrative. Arjuna, the Indian Achilles, is his son, and
pays a visit to the brilliant Celestial city on the summit
of Mount Meru, where flowers are ever blooming, and
pretty nymphs dance to pleasure battle-slain warriors.</p>

<p>Arjuna saluted his divine sire. &#8220;And Indra thereupon
embraced him with his round and plump arms.
And taking his hand, Shakra (Indra) made him sit on a
portion of his own seat.... And the lord of the
Celestials&mdash;that slayer of hostile heroes&mdash;smelt the head
of Arjuna, bending in humility, and even took him upon
his lap.... Moved by affection, the slayer of Vritra
touched that beautiful face with his own perfumed hands.
And the wielder of the thunderbolt, patting and rubbing
gently again and again with his own hands, which bore
the marks of the thunderbolt, the handsome and large
arms of Arjuna, which resembled a couple of golden
columns and were hard in consequence of drawing the
bowstring and shooting arrows, began to console him.
And the slayer of Vritra ... eyeing his son of curling
locks smilingly and with eyes expanded with delight,
seemed scarcely to be gratified. The more he gazed, the
more he liked to gaze on. And seated on one seat, the
father and son enhanced the beauty of the assembly,
like the sun and moon beautifying the firmament together.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Indra was attended in his heaven by vague spirits,
called Vasus, who appear to have acted as his counsellors.
When Bhishma, a hero of the great Bh&#259;rata war, was slain
in battle, he was given a place among the Vasus. The
Thunder god's queen is a shadowy personality, and is
called Indrani.</p>

<p>Indra was attended by a dog, as befitted a deity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
primitive huntsmen. After the early Aryan period, he
showed less favour for his bays and chariot, and seated
himself upon a great white elephant, &#8220;the handsome and
ever victorious&#8221;, named Airavata; it &#8220;was furnished with
four tusks&#8221; and &#8220;resembled the mountain of Kailasa with
its summits&#8221;.</p>

Humorous Hymn&mdash;Sources of Life&mdash;Origin of Spitting Ceremonies.</p>


<p>Agni, the fire god, was closely associated with Indra, and
is sometimes called his twin brother. The pair were the
most prominent deities in Vedic times: about 250 hymns
are addressed to Indra and over 200 to Agni.</p>

<p>Indra gave the &#8220;air of life&#8221; to men; Agni symbolized
the &#8220;vital spark&#8221;, the principle of life in animate and
inanimate Nature; he was in man, in beast, and fish; he
was in plants and trees; he was in butter and in intoxicating
Soma. The gods partook of the nature of Agni. In
one of the post-Vedic Creation myths he is identified with
the Universal soul; Brahma existed in the form of Agni
ere the worlds were framed and gods and men came to
be. Agni was made manifest in lightning, in celestial
sun flames, in the sacred blaze rising from the altar and
in homely household fires. The fire god was the divine
priest as contrasted with Indra, the divine warrior.</p>

<p>In the Vedic invocations there are evidences that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
several myths had gathered round the fascinating and
wonderful fire god. One hymn refers to him as a child
whose birth was kept a secret; his mother, the queen, concealed
him from his sire; he was born in full vigour as a
youth, and was seen sharpening his weapons at a distance
from his home which he had forsaken.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Sometimes he is
said to have devoured his parents at birth: this seems to
signify that he consumed the fire sticks from which holy
fire was produced by friction. Another hymn says that
&#8220;Heaven and Earth (Dyaus and Prithivi) fled away in
fear of (the incarnation of) Twashtri when he was born,
but they returned to embrace the lion&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>Agni was also given ten mothers who were &#8220;twice five
sisters&#8221;,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> but the reference is clearly explained in another
passage: &#8220;The ten fingers have given him birth, the
ancient, well-loved Agni, well born of his mothers&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>Dawn, with its darkness-consuming fires, and starry
Night, are the sisters of Agni; &#8220;they celebrate his three
births, one in the sea, one in the sky, one in the waters
(clouds)&#8221;. Typical of the Oriental mind is the mysterious
reference to Agni's &#8220;mothers&#8221; owing their origin to him.
The poet sings:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Who among you hath understood the hidden (god)?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The calf has by itself given birth to its mothers.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Professor Oldenberg, who suggests that the waters are
the &#8220;mothers&#8221;, reasons in Oriental mode: &#8220;Smoke is
Agni, it goes to the clouds, the clouds become waters&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>In his early humanized form Agni bears some resemblance
to Heimdal, the Teutonic sentinel god, who has
nine mothers, the daughters of sea-dwelling Ran, and is
thus also a &#8220;son of the waters&#8221;; he is clad in silvern
armour, and on his head is a burnished helmet with ram's
horns. Horsed on his swift steed, Gulltop, he watches
the demons who seek to attack the citadel of the gods....
His sight is so keen that he can see by night as well as by
day.... Heimdal is loved both by gods and by men,
and he is also called Gullintani because his teeth are of
gold. There was a time when he went to Midgard (the
earth) as a child; he grew up to be a teacher among men
and was named Scef. Scef is identified as the patriarch
Scyld in <i>Beowulf</i>, who came over the sea as a child and
rose to be the king of a tribe. Mankind were descended
from Heimdal-Scef: three sons were born to him of
human mothers&mdash;Thrall, from whom thralls are descended;
Churl, the sire of freemen, and Jarl from whom nobles
have sprung.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>In <i>Mahabharata</i> there is a fragment of an old legend
which relates the origin of Karna, the son of Queen
Pritha and the sun god: the birth of the child is concealed,
and he is placed in a basket which is set afloat on
the river and is carried to a distant country.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>One of the Vedic references to Agni, as we have seen,
suggests an origin similar to Karna of the epic period.
He was connected with the introduction of agriculture
like the Teutonic Scef, which signifies &#8220;Sheaf&#8221;. Agni
is stated to have been &#8220;carried in the waters.... The
great one has grown up in the wide unbounded space.
The waters (have made) Agni (grow)&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Agni is &#8220;sharp
faced&#8221; (i, 95); he is &#8220;the bright, brilliant, and shining
one&#8221; (iv, i. 7); he is &#8220;gold toothed&#8221; (v, 22); he sees
&#8220;even over the darkness of night&#8221; (i, 94. 7); he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> &#8220;makes
all things visible&#8221;; he conquers the godless, wicked wiles;
he sharpens his two horns in order to pierce Rakshasas
(giants) (v, 2). &#8220;O Agni, strike away with thy weapons
those who curse us, the malicious ones, all ghouls, be
they near or far&#8221; (i, 94. 9). Heimdal blows a trumpet
in battle; Agni is &#8220;roaring like a bull&#8221; (i, 94. 10).</p>

<p>As Heimdal, in his Scef-child form, was sent to mankind
by the gods, &#8220;Matarisvan<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> brought Agni to Bhrigu
as a gift, precious like wealth, of double birth, the carrier,
the famous, the beacon of the sacrifice, the ready, the
immediately successful messenger.... The Bhrigus
worshipping him in the abode of the waters have verily
established him among the clans of Ayu. The people
have established beloved Agni among the human clans
as (people) going to settle (establish) Mitra&#8221; (i, 60).
Oldenberg explains that people going anywhere secure
safety by ceremonies addressed to Mitra, i.e. by concluding
alliances under the protection of Mitra. Another
reference reads, &#8220;Agni has been established among the
tribes of men, the son of the waters, Mitra acting in the
right way&#8221;. Oldenberg notes that Mitra is here identified
with Agni; Mitra also means &#8220;friend&#8221; or &#8220;ally&#8221; (iii, 5. 3,
and note). Scyld in <i>Beowulf</i>, the mysterious child of the
sea, became a king over men. Agni &#8220;indeed is king,
leading all beings to gloriousness. As soon as born from
here, he looks over the whole world.... Agni, who has
been looked and longed for in Heaven, who has been
looked for on earth&mdash;he who has been looked for has
entered all herbs&#8221; (i, 98).<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> To Agni's love affairs upon
earth there are epic references, and in the &#8220;Vishnu
Purana&#8221; he is mentioned as the father of three human
sons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>The reference to the Bhrigus, to whom Agni is carried,
is of special interest. This tribe did not possess fire and
were searching for it (<i>Rigveda</i>, x. 40. 2). In another
poem the worshippers of Agni are &#8220;human people descended
from Manush (Manu)&#8221; (vi, 48. 8). The Bhrigus
were a priestly family descended from the patriarch Bhrigu:
Manu was the first man. Two of the Teutonic patriarch
names are Berchter and Mannus.</p>

<p>Agni was the messenger of the gods; he interceded
with the gods on behalf of mankind and conducted the
bright Celestials to the sacrifice. The priest chanted at
the altar:</p>

<p class="blockindent">Agni, the divine ministrant of the sacrifice, the
greatest bestower of treasures; may one obtain
through Agni wealth and welfare day by day,
which may bring glory and high bliss of valiant
offspring.</p>

<p class="blockindent">Agni, whatever sacrifice and worship thou encompassest
on every side, that indeed goes to the
gods. Thou art King of all worship....
Conduct the gods hither in an easy-moving
chariot.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>Like Indra, Agni was a heavy consumer of Soma; his
intensely human side is not lost in mystic Vedic poetry.</p>

<p class="blockindent">Agni, accept this log, conqueror of horses, thou who
lovest songs and delightest in riches....</p>

<p class="blockindent">Thou dost go wisely between these two creations
(Heaven and Earth) like a friendly messenger
between two hamlets....</p>

<p>His worshippers might address him with great familiarity,
as in the following extracts:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockindent">If I were thee and thou wert me, thine aspirations
should be fulfilled.</p>

<p class="blockatrib"><i>Rigveda</i>, xiii, 44. 23.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockindent">If, O Agni, thou wert a mortal and I an immortal,
I would not abandon thee to wrong or to
penury: my worshippers should not be poor,
nor distressed, nor miserable.</p>

<p class="blockatrib"><i>Rigveda</i>, viii, 19.</p>

<p>These appeals are reminiscent of the quaint graveyard
inscription:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here lie I, Martin Elginbrodde.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hae mercy on my soul, Lord God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I wad dae were I Lord God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ye were Martin Elginbrodde.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The growth of monotheistic thought is usually evinced
in all mythologies by the tendency to invest a popular
deity with the attributes of other gods. Agni is sometimes
referred to as the sky god and the storm god. In
one of the hymns he is entreated to slay demons and
send rain as if he were Indra:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O Agni, overcome our enemies and our calamities;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drive away all disease and the Rakshasas&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Send down abundance of waters<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the ocean of the sky.<br /></span>
</div>
<p class="poematrib"><i>Rigveda</i>, x, 98. 12.</p>
</div>

<p>Indra similarly absorbed, and was absorbed by, the
wind god Vayu or Vata, who is also referred to as the
father of the Maruts and the son-in-law of the artisan
god Twashtri. The name Vata has been compared to
Vate, the father of the Teutonic Volund or Wieland,
the tribal deity of the Watlings or Vaetlings; in old
English the Milky Way was &#8220;Watling Street&#8221;. Comparisons
have also been drawn with the wind god Odin&mdash;the
Anglo-Saxon Woden, and ancient German Wuotan
(pronounced Vuotan). &#8220;The etymological connection in
this view&#8221;, writes a critic, &#8220;is not free from difficulty.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>Professor Macdonell favours the derivation from &#8220;va&#8221; =
&#8220;to blow&#8221;.</p>

<p>The Indian Vata is invoked, as Vayu, in a beautiful
passage in one of the hymns which refers to his &#8220;two
red horses yoked to the chariot&#8221;: he had also, like the
Maruts, a team of deer. The poet calls to the wind:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Awake Purandhu (Morning) as a lover awakes a sleeping maid.... Reveal heaven and earth....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brighten the dawn, yea, for glory, brighten the dawn....<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These lines recall Keats at his best:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i26">There is no light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown....<br /></span>
</div>
<p class="poematrib"><i>Ode to the Nightingale.</i></p>
</div>

<p>A stirring hymn to the wind god loses much of its
vigour and beauty in translation:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sublime and shining is the car of Vata;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It sweeps resounding, thundering and crashing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Athwart the sky it wakens ruddy flashes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or o'er the earth it sets the dust-clouds whirling.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The gusts arise and hasten unto Vata,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like women going to a royal banquet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that bright car the mighty god is with them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he is rajah of the earth's dominions.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When Vata enters on the paths of heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All day he races on; he never falters;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He is the firstborn and the friend of Ocean&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence did he issue forth? Where is his birthplace?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He is the breath<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> of gods: all life is Vata:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He cometh, yea, he goeth as he listeth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His voice is heard; his form is unbeholden&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O let us offer sacrifice to Vata.<br /></span>
</div>
<p class="poematrib"><i>Rigveda</i>, x, 168.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>
<p>Another wind or storm god is Rudra, also the father
of the Maruts, who are called &#8220;Rudras&#8221;. He is the
&#8220;Howler&#8221; and &#8220;the Ruddy One&#8221;, and rides a wild
boar. Saussaye calls him &#8220;the Wild Huntsman of
Hindu Mythology&#8221;. He is chiefly of historical interest
because he developed into the prominent post-Vedic god
Shiva, the &#8220;Destroyer&#8221;, who is still worshipped in
India. The poets invested him with good as well as
evil qualities:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Rudra, thou smiter of workers of evil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The doers of good all love and adore thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Preserve me from injury and every affliction&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rudra, the nourisher.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Give unto me of thy medicines, Rudra,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that my years may reach to a hundred;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drive away hatred, shatter oppression,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ward off calamity.<br /></span>
</div>
<p class="poematrib"><i>Rigveda</i>, ii, 33.</p>
</div>

<p>The rain cloud was personified in Parjanya, who links
with Indra as the nourisher of earth, and with Agni as
the quickener of seeds.</p>

<p>Indra's great rival, however, was Varuna, who symbolized
the investing sky: he was &#8220;the all-enveloping
one&#8221;. The hymns impart to him a character of Hebraic
grandeur. He was the sustainer of the universe, the lawgiver,
the god of moral rectitude, and the sublime sovereign
of gods and men. Men worshipped him with
devoutness, admiration, and fear. &#8220;It is he who makes
the sun to shine in heaven; the winds that blow are
but his breath; he has hollowed out the channels of the
rivers which flow at his command, and he has made the
depths of the sea. His ordinances are fixed and unassailable;
through their operation the moon walks in
brightness, and the stars which appear in the nightly sky,
vanish in daylight. The birds flying in the air, the rivers
in their sleepless flow, cannot attain a knowledge of his
power and wrath. But he knows the flight of the birds
in the sky, the course of the far-travelling wind, the paths
of ships on the ocean, and beholds all secret things that
have been or shall be done. He witnesses men's truth
and falsehood.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>In contrast to the devotional spirit pervading the
Varuna hymns is the attitude adopted by Indra's worshippers;
the following prayer to the god of battle is
characteristic:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O Indra, grant the highest, best of treasures,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A judging mind, prosperity abiding,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The grace of eloquence and days propitious.<br /></span>
</div>
<p class="poematrib"><i>Rigveda</i>, ii, 21. 6.</p>
</div>

<p>The sinner's fear of Varuna prompted him to seek
the aid of other gods. Rudra and the Moon are addressed:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O remove ye the sins we have sinned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What evil may cling to us sever<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bolts and sharp weapons, kind friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gracious be ever.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the snare of Varuna deliver us, ward us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye warm-hearted gods, O help us and guard us.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Associated with Varuna was the God Mitra (the
Persian Mithra). These deities are invariably coupled
and belong to the early Iranian period. Much controversy
has been waged over their pre-Vedic significance.
Some have regarded Mithra as the firmament by day
with its blazing and fertilizing sun, and Varuna as the
many-eyed firmament of night, in short, the twin forms
of Dyaus. Prof. E. V. Arnold has shown, however, that
in the Vedas, Mithra has no solar significance except in
his association with Agni. The fire god, as we have
seen, symbolized the principle of fertility in Nature: he
was the &#8220;vital spark&#8221; which caused the growth of &#8220;all
herbs&#8221;, as well as the illuminating and warmth-giving
flames of sun and household hearth.</p>

<p>Mitra as Mithra with Varuna, and a third vague god,
Aryaman, belong to an early group of equal deities called
the Adityas, or &#8220;Celestial deities&#8221;. &#8220;It would seem
that the worship of these deities&#8221;, says Prof. Arnold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
&#8220;was already decaying in the earliest Vedic period, and
that many of them were then falling into oblivion....
In a late Vedic hymn we find that Indra boasts that he
has dethroned Varuna, and invites Agni to enter his own
service instead. We may justly infer from all these circumstances
that the worship of the &#8216;celestials&#8217; occupied
at one time in the history of the race a position of
greater importance than its place in the <i>Rigveda</i> directly
suggests.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>The following extracts from a Mitra-Varuna hymn
indicate the attitude of the early priests towards the
&#8220;Celestial deities&#8221;:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockindent">To the gods Mitra and Varuna let our praise go forth with power, with all reverence, to the two of mighty race.</p>

<p class="blockindent">These did the gods establish in royal power over themselves, because they were wise and the children of wisdom, and because they excelled in power.</p>

<p class="blockindent">They are protectors of hearth and home, of life and strength; Mitra and Varuna, prosper the mediations of your worshippers....</p>

<p class="blockindent">As the sun rises to-day do I salute Mitra and Varuna, and glorious Aryaman.... The blessings of heaven are our desire....</p>

<p class="blockatrib">
<i>Prof. Arnold's translation.</i>
</p>

<p>In Babylonian mythology the sun is the offspring of
the moon. The Semitic name of the sun god is Samas
(Shamash), the Sumerian name is Utu; among other
non-Semitic names was Mitra, &#8220;apparently the Persian
Mithra&#8221;. The bright deity also &#8220;bears the names of
his attendants &#8216;Truth&#8217; and &#8216;Righteousness&#8217;, who guided
him upon his path as judge of the earth&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>It may be that the Indian Mitra was originally a sun
god; the religion of the sun god Mithra spread into
Europe. &#8220;Dedications to Mithra the Unconquered Sun
have been found in abundance.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Vedic references suggest
that Mitra had become a complex god in the pre-Vedic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>Age, being probably associated with a group of
abstract deities&mdash;his attributes symbolized&mdash;who are
represented by the Adityas. The Mitra-Varuna group
of Celestials were the source of all heavenly gifts; they
regulated sun and moon, the winds and waters and the
seasons. If we assume that they were of Babylonian or
Sumerian origin&mdash;deities imported by a branch of Aryan
settlers who had been in contact with Babylonian civilization&mdash;their
rivalry with the older Aryan gods, Indra and
Agni, can be understood. Ultimately they were superseded,
but the influence exercised by their cult remained
and left its impress upon later Aryan religious thought.</p>

<p>The Assyrian word &#8220;metru&#8221; signifies rain.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> The
quickening rain which caused the growth of vegetation
was, of course, one of the gifts of the Celestials of the
firmament. It is of interest to note, therefore, in this
connection that Professor Frazer includes the western
Mithra among the &#8220;corn gods&#8221;. Dealing with Mithraic
sculptures, which apparently depict Mithra as the sacrificer
of the harvest bull offering, he says: &#8220;On certain
of these monuments the tail of the bull ends in three
stalks of corn, and in one of them cornstalks instead of
blood are seen issuing from the wound inflicted by the
knife&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>Commenting on the Assyrian &#8220;metru&#8221; Professor
Moulton says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> &#8220;If this is his (Mithra's) origin, we get
a reasonable basis for the Avestan (Early Persian and
Aryan) use of the word to denote a &#8216;contract&#8217;, as also for
the fact that the deity is in the Avesta patron of Truth
and in the Veda of Friendship. He is &#8216;the Mediator&#8217;
between Heaven and Earth, as the firmament was by
its position, both in nature and mythology: an easy
corollary is his function of regulating the relations of
man and man.&#8221;</p>

<p>The character of an imported deity is always influenced
by localization and tribal habits. Pastoral nomads
would therefore have emphasized the friendliness of
Mithra, who sent rain to cause the growth of grass on
sun-parched steppes. Both Mithra and Varuna had their
dwelling-place in the sea of heaven, the waters &#8220;above
the firmament&#8221; from which the rain descended. Ultimately
the Indian Mitra vanished, being completely
merged in Varuna, who became the god of ocean after
the Aryans reached the sea coast. In post-Vedic sacred
literature the priestly theorists, in the process of systematizing
their religious beliefs, taught that a great conflict
took place between the gods and demons. When
order was restored, the various deities were redistributed.
Indra remained the atmospheric god of battle, and Varuna
became the god of ocean, where, as the stern judge and
lawgiver and the punisher of wrongdoers, he kept watch
over the demons. In the &#8220;Nala and Damayanti&#8221; epic
narrative, the four &#8220;world guardians&#8221; are: Indra, king
of the gods; Agni, god of fire; Varuna, god of waters;
and Yama, judge of the dead.</p>

<p>It may be that the displacement of Varuna as supreme
deity was due to the influence of the fire-worshipping cult
of Agni, who was imported by certain unidentified Aryan
tribes that entered India. Agni did not receive recognition,
apparently, from the other Aryan &#8220;folk-wave&#8221;,
which established a military aristocracy at Mitanni in
Mesopotamia, and held sway for a period over the
Assyrians and some of the Hittite tribes. An important
inscription, which is dated about 1400 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, has been
deciphered at Boghaz-Köi in Asia Minor by Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Hugo Winckler, who gives the names of the following
deities:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Mi-it-ra, Uru-w-na, In-da-ra, and Na-sa-at-ti-ia&#8221;&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>Mitra, Varuna, Indra, Nasatya. The latter is Nasatyau,
the Vedic Aswins, twin gods of morning, who have been
compared to the Greek Dioskouri (Castor and Pollux),
sons of Zeus.</p>

<p>A Vedic triad, which suggests a rival cult to that of
the worshippers of Varuna and other Adityas, is formed
by Vayu (wind), Agni (fire), and Surya (the sun).</p>

<p>The Indian sun god Surya, like the Egyptian Ra, had
three forms. The rising sun was Vivasvat; the setting
sun was Savitri.</p>

<p>Vivasvat was the son-in-law of Twashtri, the artisan
of Nature; he was an abstract deity, and apparently owed
his origin to the group of Adityas.</p>

<p>Savitri, who had yellow hair, was of pre-Vedic origin.
He was the &#8220;Stimulator&#8221;. When he commanded Night
to approach, men ceased their labours, birds sought their
nests, and cattle their sheds.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>During the long centuries covered by the Vedic
period many &#8220;schools of thought&#8221; must have struggled
for supremacy. The Vivasvat myth belongs, it would
appear, to the time before the elephant was tamed by
the Aryans. Aditi, the mother of the Adityas, who is
believed to be of later origin than her children, had eight
sons. She cherished seven of them; the eighth, which
was a shapeless lump, was thrown away, but was afterwards
moulded into Vivasvat, the sun; the pieces of the lump
which were cast away by the divine artisan fell upon the
earth and gave origin to the elephant, therefore elephants
should not be caught, because they partake of divine nature.</p>

<p>Surya is an Aryanized sun god. He drives a golden
chariot drawn by seven mares, or a mare with seven
heads; he has golden hair and golden arms and hands.
As he is alluded to as &#8220;the eye of Varuna and Mitra&#8221;,
and a son of Aditi, it is evident that if he did not originally
belong to the group of Adityas, he was strongly
influenced by them. In his Savitri character, which he
possesses at morning as well as at evening, he stimulates
all life and the mind of man. One of the most sacred
and oldest mantras (texts) in the Vedas is still addressed
by Brahmans to the rising sun. It runs:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">May he enlighten (or stimulate) our understandings.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a><br /></span>

<p>The feeling for Nature pervades the ancient religion
and literature of India. Priests were poets and singers in
early Vedic times. A Rishi was a composer of hymns to
the gods, and several are named in the collections. Every
great family appears to have had its bardic priest, and its
special poetic anthology which was handed down from
generation to generation. Old poems might be rewritten
and added to, but the ambition of the sacred poet was to
sing a new song to the gods. The oldest Vedic hymns
are referred to as &#8220;new songs&#8221;, which suggests that
others were already in existence.</p>

<p>These Rishis looked upon Nature with the poet's
eye. They symbolized everything, but they revelled also
in the gorgeous beauty of dawn and evening, the luxuriance
of Indian trees and flowers, the serene majesty of
Himalayan mountains, the cascades, the rivers, and the
shining lakes. The wonder and mystery of the world
inspired their hymns and their religion. Even the gods
took delight in the songs of birds, the harping of forest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
winds, the humming of bees, the blossoming trees, and
the flower-decked sward. Heaven has its eternal summer
and soft scented winds, its lotus-gemmed lakes and
never-fading blooms.</p>

<p>The effulgence and silence of dawn inspired some of
the most beautiful Vedic hymns. Dawn is Ushas, the
daughter of Dyaus; she is the Indian Aurora:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hail, ruddy Ushas, golden goddess, borne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon thy shining car, thou comest like<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lovely maiden by her mother decked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disclosing coyly all thy hidden graces<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To our admiring eyes; or like a wife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unveiling to her lord, with conscious pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beauties which, as he gazes lovingly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seem fresher, fairer, each succeeding morn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through years and years thou hast lived on, and yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou'rt ever young. Thou art the breath of life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all that breathes and lives, awaking day by day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Myriads of prostrate sleepers, as from death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Causing the birds to flutter from their nests,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rousing men to ply with busy feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their daily duties and appointed tasks,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>The Vedic poets &#8220;looked before and after&#8221;. One
sang:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In ages past did mortals gaze<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On Ushas veiled in gleaming gold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We who are living watch her rays,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And men unborn will her behold.<br /></span>
</div>
<p class="poematrib"><i>Rigveda</i>, i, 113. 11.</p>
</div>

<p>Night, Ratri, is the sister of Dawn. The one robes
herself in crimson and gold; the other adorns her dark
raiment with gleaming stars. When benevolent Ratri
draws nigh, men turn towards their homes to rest, birds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
seek their nests, cattle lie down; even the hawk reposes.
The people pray to the goddess to be protected against
robbers and fierce wolves, and to be taken safely across
her shadow:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She, the immortal goddess, throws her veil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over low valley, rising ground, and hill.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The darkness she produces; soon advancing<br /></span>

<p>The moon is the god Chandra, who became identified
with Soma. Among ancient peoples the moon was regarded
as the source of fertility and growth; it brought
dew to nourish crops which ripened under the &#8220;harvest
moon&#8221;; it filled all vegetation with sap; it swayed human
life from birth till death; it influenced animate and inanimate
Nature in its periods of increase and decline;
ceremonies to secure offspring were performed during
certain phases of the moon.</p>

<p>Soma was the intoxicating juice of the now unknown
Soma plant, which inspired mortals and was the nectar of
the gods. The whole ninth book of the <i>Rigveda</i> is
devoted to the praises of Soma, who is exalted even as
the chief god, the Father of all.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>&#8220;The sun&#8221;, declared one of the poets, &#8220;has the
nature of Agni, the moon of Soma.&#8221; At the same time
Agni was a great consumer of Soma; when it was poured
on the altar, the fire god leapt up joyfully. The beverage
was the &#8220;water of life&#8221; which was believed to sustain the
Adityas and the earth, and to give immortality to all the
gods; it was therefore called Amrita (ambrosia).</p>

<p>As in Teutonic mythology, the Hindu giants desired
greatly to possess the &#8220;mead&#8221; to which the gods owed
their power and supremacy. The association of Soma
with the moon recalls the Germanic belief that the magic
mead was kept for Odin, &#8220;the champion drinker&#8221;, by
Mani, the moon god, who snatched it from the mythical
children who are the prototypes of &#8220;Jack and Jill&#8221; of
the nursery rhyme.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Indra was the discoverer of the
Soma plant and brought it from the mountains. The
Persian mead (mada) was called Haoma.</p>

<p>The priests drank Soma when they made offerings
and lauded the gods. A semi-humorous Rigvedic hymn
compares them to the frogs which croak together when
the rain comes after long drought.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Each (frog) with merry croak and loudly calling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Salutes the other, as a son his father;<br /></span>

<p>There are references in the <i>Rigveda</i> to the marriage of
Soma, the moon, and Suryá, the maiden of the sun.</p>

<p>In Vedic religion many primitive beliefs were blended.
We have seen, for instance, that life was identified with
breath and wind; the &#8220;spirit&#8221; left the body as the last
breath. Agni worshippers regarded fire as &#8220;the vital
spark&#8221;. Soma worship, on the other hand, appears to
be connected with the belief that life was in the blood;
it was literally &#8220;the life blood&#8221;. The &#8220;blood of trees&#8221;
was the name for sap; sap was water impregnated or
vitalized by Soma, the essence of life. Water worship
and Soma worship were probably identical, the moon,
which was believed to be the source of growth and
moisture, being the fountain head of &#8220;the water of life&#8221;.
In Teutonic mythology the &#8220;mead&#8221; is taken from a
hidden mountain spring, which issued from &#8220;Mimer's
well&#8221; in the Underworld. Odin drank from Mimer's
well and obtained wisdom and long life. The &#8220;mead&#8221;
was transported to the moon. The &#8220;mead&#8221; was also
identified with saliva, the moisture of life, and spitting
ceremonies resulted; these survive in the custom still
practised in our rural districts of spitting on the hand to
seal a bargain; &#8220;spitting stones&#8221; have not yet entirely
disappeared. Vows are still taken in India before a fire.
References to contracts signed in blood are common and
widespread.</p>

<p>In early Vedic times the dead might be either buried or
cremated. These two customs were obviously based
upon divergent beliefs regarding the future state of existence.
A Varuna hymn makes reference to the &#8220;house
of clay&#8221;, which suggests that among some of the Aryan
tribes the belief originally obtained that the spirits of the
dead hovered round the place of sepulture. Indeed,
the dread of ghosts is still prevalent in India; they are
supposed to haunt the living until the body is burned.</p>

<p>Those who practised the cremation ceremony in early
times appear to have conceived of an organized Hades, to
which souls were transferred through the medium of fire,
which drove away all spirits and demons who threatened
mankind. Homer makes the haunting ghost of Patroklos
exclaim, &#8220;Never again will I return from Hades when I
have received my meed of fire&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> The Vedic worshippers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>of Agni burned their dead for the same reason as did the
ancient Greeks. &#8220;When the remains of the deceased
have been placed on the funeral pile, and the process of
cremation has commenced, Agni, the god of fire, is prayed
not to scorch or consume the departed, not to tear asunder
his skin or his limbs, but, after the flames have done their
work, to convey to the fathers the mortal who has been
presented to him as an offering. Leaving behind on
earth all that is evil and imperfect, and proceeding by the
paths which the fathers trod, invested with a lustre like
that of the gods, it soars to the realms of eternal light in
a car, or on wings, and recovers there its ancient body in
a complete and glorified form; meets with the forefathers
who are living in festivity with Yama; obtains from him,
when recognized by him as one of his own, a delectable
abode, and enters upon more perfect life, which is crowned
with the fulfilment of all desires, is passed in the presence
of the gods, and employed in the fulfilment of their
pleasure.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>Agni is the god who is invoked by the other deities,
&#8220;Make straight the pathways that lead to the gods; be
kind to us, and carry the sacrifice for us&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>In this connection, however, Professor Macdonell
says, &#8220;Some passages of the <i>Rigveda</i> distinguish the path
of the fathers or dead ancestors from the path of the gods,
doubtless because cremation appeared as a different process
from sacrifice&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>It would appear that prior to the practice of cremation
a belief in Paradise ultimately obtained: the dead walked
on foot towards it. Yama, King of the Dead, was the
first man.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Like the Aryan pioneers who discovered the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>Punjab, he explored the hidden regions and discovered the
road which became known as &#8220;the path of the fathers&#8221;.</p>

literature; they are the primeval &#8220;twins&#8221;, the children of
Vivasvat, or Vivasvant, in the <i>Rigveda</i> and of Vivahvant
in the <i>Avesta</i>. <i>Yama</i> signifies twin, and Dr. Rendel Harris,
in his researches on the Greek Dioscuri cult, shows that
among early peoples the belief obtained widely that one
of each pair of twins was believed to be a child of the
sky. &#8220;This conjecture is borne out by the name of
Yama's father (Vivasvant), which may well be a cult-epithet
of the bright sky, &#8216;shining abroad&#8217; (from the root
<i>vas</i>, &#8216;to shine&#8217;)&#8221;.... In the <i>Avesta</i> &#8216;Yima, the bright&#8217;
is referred to: he is the Jamshid of Fitzgerald's Omar.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>Yima, the Iranian ruler of Paradise, is also identical
with Mitra (Mithra), whose cult &#8220;obtained from 200-400
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> a world-wide diffusion in the Roman Empire,
and came nearer to monotheism than the cult of any
other god in paganism&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>Professor Moulton wonders if the Yama myth &#8220;owed
anything to Babylon?&#8221; It is possible that the worshippers
of Agni represented early Iranian beliefs, and
that the worshippers of Mitra, Varuna, and the twins
(Yama and Yima and the twin Aswins) were influenced
by Babylonian mythology as a result of contact, and that
these opposing sects were rivals in India in early Vedic
times.</p>

<p>In one of the hymns<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Yami is the wooer of her
brother Yama. She declares that they were at the beginning
intended by the gods to be husband and wife,
but Yama replies:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Who has sure knowledge of that earliest day? Who has
seen it with his eyes and can tell of it? Lofty is the law of
Mitra and Varuna; how canst thou dare to speak as a temptress?&#8221;</p>

<p class="right"><i>Arnold's translation.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>In the Vedic &#8220;land of the fathers&#8221;, the shining Paradise,
the two kings Varuna and Yama sit below a tree.
Yama, a form of Mitra, plays on a flute and drinks Soma
with the Celestials, because Soma gives immortality. He
gathers his people to him as a shepherd gathers his flock:
indeed he is called the &#8220;Noble Shepherd&#8221;. He gives to
the faithful the draught of Soma; apparently unbelievers
were destroyed or committed to a hell called Put. Yama's
messengers were the pigeon and the owl; he had also two
brindled watch-dogs, each with four eyes. The dead who
had faithfully fulfilled religious ordinances were addressed:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i23">Fear not to pass the guards&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The four-eyed brindled dogs&mdash;that watch for the departed.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Leave thou behind on earth; assume a shining form&mdash;<br /></span>

</div>

<p>Yama judged men as Dharma-rajah, &#8220;King of
righteousness&#8221;; he was Pitripati, &#8220;lord of the fathers&#8221;;
Samavurti, &#8220;the impartial judge&#8221;; Kritana, &#8220;the finisher&#8221;;
Antaka, &#8220;he who ends life&#8221;; Samana, &#8220;the leveller&#8221;, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In post-Vedic times he presided over a complicated
system of Hells; he was Dandadhara, &#8220;the wielder of
the rod or mace&#8221;. He had a noose with which to bind
souls; he carried out the decrees of the gods, taking
possession of souls at their appointed time.</p>

<p>In one of the <i>Brahmanas</i> death, or the soul which
Death claims as his own, is &#8220;the man in the eye&#8221;. The
reflection of a face in the pupil of the eye was regarded
with great awe by the early folk; it was the spirit looking
forth. We read, &#8220;Now that man in yonder orb (of the
sun) and that man in the right eye truly are no other than
Death; his feet have stuck fast in the heart, and having
pulled them out, he comes forth; and when he comes
forth then that man dies; whence they say of him who
has passed away, &#8216;<i>he has been cut off</i>&#8217; (life or life-string
has been severed)&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>Yama might consent to prolong the life of one whose
days had run out, on condition that another individual
gave up part of his own life in compensation; he might
even agree to restore a soul which he had bound to carry
away, in response to the appeal of a mortal who had
attained to great piety. The Vedic character of Yama
survives sometimes in Epic narrative even after cremation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>had become general. The following two touching and
beautiful stories, preserved in <i>Mahabharata</i>, are probably
very ancient Aryan folk tales which were cherished by
the people and retold by the poets, who attached to them
later religious beliefs and practices.</p>


<h3><a name="THE_BRAHMAN_AND_HIS_BRIDE" id="THE_BRAHMAN_AND_HIS_BRIDE">THE BRAHMAN AND HIS BRIDE</a></h3>

<p>Once upon a time Menaka, the beautiful Apsara
(celestial fairy), who is without shame or pity, left beside
a hermitage her new-born babe, the daughter of the
King of Gandharvas (celestial elves). A pious Rishi,
named Sthula-kesha, found the child and reared her.
She was called Pramadarva, and grew to be the most
beautiful and most pious of all young women. Ruru,
the great grandson of Bhrigu, looked upon her with
eyes of love, and at the request of his sire, Pramati, the
virgin was betrothed to the young Brahman.</p>

<p>It chanced that Pramadarva was playing with her
companions a few days before the morning fixed for
the nuptials. As her time had come, she trod upon a
serpent, and the death-compelling reptile bit her, whereupon
she fell down in a swoon and expired. She became
more beautiful in death than she had been in life.</p>

<p>Brahmans assembled round the body of Pramadarva
and sorrowed greatly. Ruru stole away alone and went
to a solitary place in the forest where he wept aloud.
&#8220;Alas!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;the fair one, whom I love more
dearly than ever, lieth dead upon the bare ground. If
I have performed penances and attained to great ascetic
merit, let the power which I have achieved restore my
beloved to life again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly there appeared before Ruru an emissary
from the Celestial regions, who spake and said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> &#8220;Thy
prayer is of no avail, O Ruru. That one whose days
have been numbered can never get back her own life again.
Thou shouldst not therefore abandon thine heart to
grief. But the gods have decreed a means whereby thou
canst receive back thy beloved.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Ruru: &#8220;Tell me how I can comply with the
will of the Celestials, O messenger, so that I may be
delivered from my grief.&#8221;</p>

<p>The messenger said: &#8220;If thou wilt resign half of thine
own life to this maiden, Pramadvara, she will rise up again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Ruru: &#8220;I will resign half of my own life so that
my beloved may be restored unto me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the king of the Gandharvas and the Celestial
emissary stood before Dharma-rajah (Yama) and said:
&#8220;If it be thy will, O Mighty One, let Pramadarva rise
up endowed with a part of Ruru's life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said the Judge of the Dead: &#8220;So be it.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Dharma-rajah had spoken thus, the serpent-bitten
maiden rose from the ground, and Ruru, whose
life was curtailed for her sake, obtained the sweetest wife
upon earth. The happy pair spent their days deeply
devoted to each other, awaiting the call of Yama at the
appointed time.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>


<h3><a name="STORY_OF_SAVITRI" id="STORY_OF_SAVITRI">STORY OF SAVITRI</a></h3>

<p>There was once a fair princess in the country of
Madra, and her name was Savitri. Be it told how she
obtained the exalted merit of chaste women by winning
a great boon from Yama.</p>

<p>Savitri was the gift of the goddess Gayatri,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> wife of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>Brahma, the self-created, who had heard the prayers and
received the offerings of Aswapati, the childless king of
Madra, when he practised austere penances so that he
might have issue. The maiden grew to be beautiful and
shapely like to a Celestial; her eyes had burning splendour,
and were fair as lotus leaves; she resembled a golden
image; she had exceeding sweetness and grace.</p>

<p>It came to pass that Savitri looked with eyes of love
upon a youth named Satyavan &#8220;the Truthful&#8221;. Although
Satyavan dwelt in a hermitage, he was of royal birth.
His father was a virtuous king, named Dyumatsena, who
became blind, and was then deprived of his kingdom by
an old enemy dwelling nigh to him. The dethroned
monarch retired to the forest with his faithful wife and
his only son, who in time grew up to be a comely youth.</p>

<p>When Savitri confessed her love to her sire, the great
sage Narada, who sat beside him, spoke and said: &#8220;Alas!
the princess hath done wrong in choosing for her husband
this royal youth Satyavan. He is comely and courageous,
he is truthful and magnanimous and forgiving, he is
modest and patient and without malice; honour is seated
upon his forehead; he is possessed of every virtue. But
he hath one defect, and no other. He is endued with
short life; within a year from this day he must die, for
so hath it been decreed; within a year Yama, god of the
dead, will come for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said the king unto his daughter: &#8220;O Savitri, thou
hast heard the words of Narada. Go forth, therefore, and
choose for thyself another lord, for the days of Satyavan
are numbered.&#8221;</p>

<p>The beautiful maiden made answer unto her father
the king, saying:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> &#8220;The die is cast; it can fall but once;
once only can a daughter be given away by her sire;
once only can a woman say, &#8216;<i>I am thine</i>&#8217;. I have chosen
my lord; once have I chosen, nor can I make choice a
second time. Let his life be brief or be long, I must now
wed Satyavan.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Narada: &#8220;O king, the heart of thy daughter
will not waver; she will not be turned aside from the
path she hath selected. I therefore approve of the bestowal
of Savitri upon Satyavan.&#8221;</p>

<p>The king said: &#8220;As thou dost advise, so must I do
ever, O Narada, because that thou art my preceptor.
Thee I cannot disobey.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said Narada: &#8220;Peace be with Savitri! I must
now depart. May blessings attend upon all of you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereafter Aswapati, the royal sire of Savitri, went to
visit Dyumatsena, the blind sire of Satyavan, in the forest,
and his daughter went with him.</p>

<p>Said Dyumatsena: &#8220;Why hast thou come hither?&#8221;</p>

<p>Aswapati said: &#8220;O royal sage, this is my beautiful
daughter Savitri. Take thou her for thy daughter-in-law.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Dyumatsena: &#8220;I have lost my kingdom, and
with my wife and my son dwell here in the woods. We
live as ascetics and perform great penances. How will
thy daughter endure the hardships of a forest life?&#8221;</p>

<p>Aswapati said: &#8220;My daughter knoweth well that joy
and sorrow come and go and that nowhere is bliss assured.
Accept her therefore from me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Dyumatsena consented that his son should wed
Savitri, whereat Satyavan was made glad because he was
given a wife who had every accomplishment. Savitri
rejoiced also because she obtained a husband after her own
heart, and she put off her royal garments and ornaments
and clad herself in bark and red cloth.</p>

<p>So Savitri became a hermit woman. She honoured
Satyavan's father and mother, and she gave great joy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
her husband with her sweet speeches, her skill at work,
her subdued and even temper, and especially her love.
She lived the life of the ascetics and practised every
austerity. But she never forgot the dread prophecy of
Narada the sage; his sorrowful words were always present
in her secret heart, and she counted the days as they went
past.</p>

<p>At length the time drew nigh when Satyavan must
cast off his mortal body. When he had but four days to
live, Savitri took the <i>Tritatra</i> vow of three nights of
sleepless penance and fast.</p>

<p>Said the blind Dyumatsena: &#8220;My heart is grieved
for thee, O my daughter, because the vow is exceedingly
hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>Savitri said: &#8220;Be not sorrowful, saintly father, I
must observe my vow without fail.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Dyumatsena: &#8220;It is not meet that one like me
should say, &#8216;Break thy vow,&#8217; rather should I counsel,
&#8216;Observe thy vow.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Savitri began to fast, and she grew pale and was
much wasted by reason of her rigid penance. Three
days passed away, and then, believing that her husband
would die on the morrow, Savitri spent a night of bitter
anguish through all the dark and lonely hours.</p>

<p>The sun rose at length on the fateful morning, and
she said to herself, &#8220;<i>To-day is the day</i>.&#8221; Her face was
bloodless but brave; she prayed in silence and with
fervour and offered oblations at the morning fire; then
she stood before her father-in-law and her mother-in-law
in reverent silence with joined hands, concentrating her
senses. All the hermits of the forest blessed her and
said: &#8220;Mayest thou never suffer widowhood.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Savitri in her secret heart: &#8220;So be it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dyumatsena spoke to her then, saying:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> &#8220;Now that
thy vow hath been completed thou mayest eat the morning
meal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Savitri: &#8220;I will eat when the sun goes down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hearing her words Satyavan rose, and taking his axe
upon his shoulder, turned towards the distant jungle to
procure fruits and herbs for his wife, whom he loved. He
was strong and self-possessed and of noble seeming.</p>

<p>Savitri spoke to him sweetly and said: &#8220;Thou must
not go forth alone, my husband. It is my heart's desire
to go with thee. I cannot endure to-day to be parted
from thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Satyavan: &#8220;It is not for thee to enter the darksome
jungle; the way is long and difficult, and thou art
weak on account of thy severe penance. How canst thou
walk so far on foot?&#8221;</p>

<p>Savitri laid her head upon his bosom and said: &#8220;I
have not been made weary by my fast. Indeed I am
now stronger than before. I will not feel tired when
thou art by my side. I have resolved to go with
thee: do not therefore seek to thwart my wish&mdash;the
wish and the longing of a faithful wife to be with her
lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Satyavan: &#8220;If it is thy desire to accompany me
I cannot but gratify it. But thou must ask permission of
my parents lest they find fault with me for taking thee
through the trackless jungle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Savitri spoke to the blind sage and her husband's
mother and said: &#8220;Satyavan is going towards the deep
jungle to procure fruits and herbs for me, and also fuel
for the sacrificial fires. It is my heart's wish to go also,
for to-day I cannot endure to be parted from him. Fain,
too, would I behold the blossoming woods.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Dyumatsena:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> &#8220;Since thou hast come to dwell
with us in our hermitage thou hast not before asked
anything of us. Have thy desire therefore in this matter,
but do not delay thy husband in his duties.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having thus received permission to depart from the
hermitage, Savitri turned towards the jungle with Satyavan,
her beloved lord. Smiles covered her face, but her heart
was torn with secret sorrow.</p>

<p>Peacocks fluttered in the green woodland through
which they walked together, and the sun shone in all its
splendour in the blue heaven.</p>

<p>Said Satyavan with sweet voice: &#8220;How beautiful are
the bright streams and the blossoming trees!&#8221;</p>

<p>The heart of Savitri was divided into two parts: with
one she held converse with her husband while she watched
his face and followed his moods; with the other she
awaited the dread coming of Yama, but she never uttered
her fears.</p>

<p>Birds sang sweetly in the forest, but sweeter to Savitri
was the voice of her beloved. It was very dear to her
to walk on in silence, listening to his words.</p>

<p>Satyavan gathered fruits and stored them in his
basket. At length he began to cut down the branches
of trees. The sun was hot and he perspired. Suddenly
he felt weary and he said: &#8220;My head aches; my senses
are confused, my limbs have grown weak, and my heart is
afflicted sorely. O silent one, a sickness hath seized me.
My body seems to be pierced by a hundred darts. I
would fain lie down and rest, my beloved; I would fain
sleep even now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Speechless and terror-stricken, the gentle Savitri
wound her arms about her husband's body; she sat
upon the ground and she pillowed his head upon her
lap. Remembering the words of Narada, she knew that
the dread hour had come; the very moment of death
was at hand. Gently she held her husband's head with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
caressing hands; she kissed his panting lips; her heart
was beating fast and loud. Darker grew the forest and
it was lonesome indeed.</p>

<p>Suddenly an awful Shape emerged from the shadows.
He was of great stature and sable hue; his raiment was
blood-red; on his head he wore a gleaming diadem; he
had red eyes and was fearsome to look upon; he carried
a noose.... The Shape was Yama, god of death. He
stood in silence, and gazed upon slumbering Satyavan.</p>

<p>Savitri looked up, and when she perceived that a
Celestial had come nigh, her heart trembled with sorrow
and with fear. She laid her husband's head upon the
green sward and rose up quickly: then she spake, saying,
&#8220;Who art thou, O divine One, and what is thy mission
to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yama: &#8220;Thou dost love thy husband; thou art
endued also with ascetic merit. I will therefore hold
converse with thee. Know thou that I am the Monarch
of Death. The days of this man, thy husband, are now
spent, and I have come to bind him and take him away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Savitri said: &#8220;Wise sages have told me that thy
messengers carry mortals away. Why, then, O mighty
King, hast thou thyself come hither?&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yama: &#8220;This prince is of spotless heart; his
virtues are without number; he is, indeed, an ocean
of accomplishments. It would not be fitting to send
messengers for him, so I myself have come hither.&#8221;</p>

<p>The face of Satyavan had grown ashen pale. Yama
cast his noose and tore out from the prince's body the
soul-form, which was no larger than a man's thumb; it
was tightly bound and subdued.</p>

<p>So Satyavan lost his life; he ceased to breathe; his
body became unsightly; it was robbed of its lustre and
deprived of power to move.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>Yama fettered the soul with tightness, and turned
abruptly towards the south; silently and speedily he
went upon his way....</p>

<p>Savitri followed him.... Her heart was drowned
in grief. She could not desert her beloved lord....
She followed Yama, the Monarch of Death.</p>

<p>Said Yama: &#8220;Turn back, O Savitri. Do not follow
me. Perform the funeral rites of thy lord.... Thine
allegiance to Satyavan hath now come to an end: thou
art free from all wifely duties. Dare not to proceed
farther on this path.&#8221;</p>

<p>Savitri said: &#8220;I must follow my husband whither he
is carried or whither he goeth of his own will. I have
undergone great penance. I have observed my vow, and
I cannot be turned back.... I have already walked with
thee seven paces, and the sages have declared that one
who walketh seven paces with another becometh a companion.
Being thus made thy friend, I must hold converse
with thee, I must speak and thou must listen....
I have attained the perfect life upon earth by performing
my vows and by reason of my devotion unto my lord.
It is not meet that thou shouldest part me from my
husband now, and prevent me from attaining bliss by
saying that my allegiance to him hath ended and another
mode of life is opened to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yama: &#8220;Turn back now.... Thy words are
wise and pleasing indeed; therefore, ere thou goest, thou
canst ask a boon of me and I will grant it. Except the
soul of Satyavan, I will give thee whatsoever thou dost
desire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Savitri said: &#8220;Because my husband's sire became
blind, he was deprived of his kingdom. Restore his
eyesight, O mighty One.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yama:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> &#8220;The boon is granted. I will restore the
vision of thy father-in-law.... But thou hast now
grown faint on this toilsome journey. Turn back, therefore,
and thy weariness will pass away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Savitri said: &#8220;How can I be weary when I am with
my husband? The fate of my husband will be my fate
also; I will follow him even unto the place whither thou
dost carry him.... Hear me, O mighty One, whose
friendship I cherish! It is a blessed thing to behold
a Celestial; still more blessed is it to hold converse with
one; the friendship of a god must bear great fruit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yama: &#8220;Thy wisdom delighteth my heart. Therefore
thou canst ask of me a second boon, except the life
of thy husband, and it will be granted thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Savitri said: &#8220;May my wise and saintly father-in-law
regain the kingdom he hath lost. May he become
once again the protector of his people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yama: &#8220;The boon is granted. The king will
return to his people and be their wise protector.... Turn
back now, O princess; thy desire is fulfilled.&#8221;</p>

<p>Savitri said: &#8220;All people must obey thy decrees; thou
dost take away life in accordance with divine ordinances
and not of thine own will. Therefore thou art called
Yama&mdash;he that ruleth by decrees. Hear my words, O
divine One. It is the duty of Celestials to love all
creatures and to award them according to their merit.
The wicked are without holiness and devotion, but the
saintly protect all creatures and show mercy even unto
their enemies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yama: &#8220;Thy wise words are like water to a
thirsty soul. Ask of me therefore a third boon, except
thy husband's life, and it will be granted unto thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Savitri said: &#8220;My sire, King Aswapati, hath no son.
O grant that a hundred sons may be born unto him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yama: &#8220;A hundred sons will be born unto thy
royal sire. Thy boon is granted.... Turn back, therefore,
O princess; thou canst not come farther. Long
is the path thou hast already travelled.&#8221;</p>

<p>Savitri said: &#8220;I have followed my husband and the
way hath not seemed long. Indeed, my heart desireth
to go on much farther. Hear my words, O Yama, as
thou dost proceed on thy journey. Thou art great and
wise and powerful; thou dost deal equally with all human
creatures; thou art the lord of justice.... One cannot
trust oneself as one can trust a Celestial; therefore, one
seeketh to win the friendship of a Celestial. It is meet
that one who seeketh the friendship of a Celestial should
make answer to his words.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yama: &#8220;No mortal hath ever spoken unto me
as thou hast spoken. Thy words are indeed pleasing,
O princess. I will grant thee even a fourth boon, except
thy husband's life, ere thou dost depart.&#8221;</p>

<p>Savitri said: &#8220;May a century of sons be born unto
my husband and me so that our race may endure. O
grant me this, the fourth boon, thou Mighty One.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yama: &#8220;I grant unto thee a century of sons,
O princess; they will be wise and powerful and thy race
will endure.... Be without weariness now, O lady,
and turn back; thou hast come too far already.&#8221;</p>

<p>Savitri said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> &#8220;Those who are pious must practise
eternal morality, O Yama. The pious uphold the universe.
The pious hold communion with the pious only,
and are never weary; the pious do good unto others nor
ever expect any reward. A good deed done unto the
righteous is never thrown away; such an act doth not
entail loss of dignity nor is any interest impaired. Indeed,
the doing of good is the chief office of the righteous,
and the righteous therefore are the true protectors of
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yama: &#8220;The more thou dost speak, the more
I respect thee, O princess. O thou who art so deeply
devoted unto thy husband, thou canst now ask of me
some incomparable boon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Savitri said: &#8220;O mighty One, thou bestower of
boons, thou hast already promised what cannot be fulfilled
unless my husband is restored unto me; thou hast
promised me a century of sons. Therefore, I ask thee,
O Yama, to give me back Satyavan, my beloved, my
lord. Without him, I am as one who is dead; without
him, I have no desire for happiness; without him I have
no longing even for Heaven; I will have no desire to
prosper if my lord is snatched off; I cannot live without
Satyavan. Thou hast promised me sons, O Yama, yet
thou dost take away my husband from mine arms.
Hear me and grant this boon: Let Satyavan be restored
to life so that thy decree may be fulfilled.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yama: &#8220;So be it. With cheerful heart I now
unbind thy husband. He is free.... Disease cannot
afflict him again and he will prosper. Together you will
both have long life; you will live four hundred years;
you will have a century of sons and they will be kings,
and their sons will be kings also.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having spoken thus, Yama, the lord of death, departed
unto his own place. And Savitri returned to the
forest where her husband's body lay cold and ashen-pale;
she sat upon the ground and pillowed his head upon her
lap. Then Satyavan was given back his life.... He
looked upon Savitri with eyes of love; he was like to
one who had returned from a long journey in a strange
land.</p>

<p>Said Satyavan:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> &#8220;Long was my sleep; why didst
thou not awaken me, my beloved?... Where is that
dark One who dragged me away?&#8221;</p>

<p>Savitri said: &#8220;Yama hath come and gone, and thou
hast slept long, resting thy head upon my lap, and art
now refreshed, O blessed one. Sleep hath forsaken thee,
O son of a king. If thou canst rise up, let us now
depart hence for the night is already dark....&#8221;</p>

<p>Satyavan rose up refreshed and strong. He looked
round about and perceived that he was in the midst of
the forest. Then he said: &#8220;O fair one, I came hither
to gather fruit for thee, and while I cut down branches
from the trees a pain afflicted me. I grew faint, I sank
upon the ground, I laid my head upon thy lap and fell
into a deep slumber even whilst thou didst embrace me.
Then it seemed to me that I was enveloped in darkness,
and that I beheld a sable One amidst great effulgence....
Was this a vision or a reality, O fairest and
dearest?&#8221;</p>

<p>Savitri said: &#8220;The darkness deepens.... I will
tell thee all on the morrow.... Let us now find our
parents, O prince. The beasts of the night come forth;
I hear their awesome voices; they tread the forest in
glee; the howl of the jackal maketh my heart afraid.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>Said Satyavan: &#8220;Darkness hath covered the forest
with fear; we cannot discover the path by which to
return home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Savitri said: &#8220;A withered tree burneth yonder. I
will gather sticks and make a fire and we will wait here
until day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Satyavan:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> &#8220;My sickness hath departed and I
would fain behold my parents again. Never before have
I spent a night away from the hermitage. My mother
is old and my father also, and I am their crutch. They
will now be afflicted with sorrow because that we have
not returned.&#8221;</p>

<p>Satyavan lifted up his arms and lamented aloud, but
Savitri dried his tears and said: &#8220;I have performed
penances, I have given away in charity, I have offered
up sacrifices, I have never uttered a falsehood. May
thy parents be protected by virtue of the power which
I have obtained, and may thou, O my husband, be
protected also.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Satyavan: &#8220;O beautiful one, let us now return
to the hermitage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Savitri raised up her despairing husband. She then
placed his left arm upon her left shoulder and wound
her right arm about his body, and they walked on together....
At length the fair moon came out and
shone upon their path.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Dyumatsena, the sire of Satyavan, had
regained his sight, and he went with his wife to search
for his lost son, but had to return to the hermitage
sorrowing and in despair. The sages comforted the
weeping parents and said: &#8220;Savitri hath practised great
austerities, and there can be no doubt that Satyavan is
still alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>In time Satyavan and Savitri reached the hermitage,
and their own hearts and the hearts of their parents were
freed from sorrow.</p>

<p>Then Savitri related all that had taken place, and the
sages said: &#8220;O chaste and illustrious lady, thou hast
rescued the race of Dyumatsena, the foremost of kings,
from the ocean of darkness and calamity.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the morning that followed messengers came to
Dyumatsena and told that the monarch who had deprived
him of his kingdom was dead, having fallen by the hand
of his chief minister. All the people clamoured for their
legitimate ruler. Said the messengers:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> &#8220;Chariots await
thee, O king. Return, therefore, unto thy kingdom.&#8221;</p>

<p>Great was their wonder to find that Dyumatsena was
no longer blind.</p>

<p>So the king was restored to his kingdom, in accordance
with the boon which Savitri had obtained from Yama.
And sons were in time born unto her father. Thus did
the gentle Savitri, by reason of her great piety, raise from
misery to high fortune the family of her husband and her
own father also. She was the rescuer of all; the bringer
of happiness and prosperity.... He who heareth the
story of Savitri will never endure misery again....</p>

<p>The beauties of Yama's heaven are sung by the sage
Narada in the great epic poem <i>Mahabharata</i>.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> &#8220;Listen
to me,&#8221; he says.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> &#8220;In that fair domain it is neither too
hot nor too cold. Life there is devoid of sorrow; age
does not bring frailties, and none ever hunger or thirst;
it is without wretchedness, or fatigue, or evil feelings.
Everything, whether celestial or human, that the heart
seeks after is found there. Sweet are the juicy fruits,
delicious the fragrance of flowers and tree blossoms, and
waters are there, both cold and hot, to give refreshment
and comfort. Nymphs dance and sing to the piping of
celestial elves, and merry laughter ever blends with the
strains of alluring music.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Assembly House of Yama, which was made by
Twashtri, hath splendour equal to the sun; it shines like
burnished gold. There the servants of the Lord of
Justice measure out the allotted days of mortals. Great
rishis and ancestors await upon Yama, King of the Pitris
(fathers), and adore him. Sanctified by holiness, their
shining bodies are clad in swan-white garments, and
decked with many-coloured bracelets and golden ear-rings.
Sweet sounds, alluring perfumes, and brilliant
flower garlands make that building ever pleasant and
supremely blest. Hundreds of thousands of saintly
beings worship the illustrious King of the Pitris.</p>

<p>&#8220;The heaven of Indra was constructed by the great
artisan-god himself. Like a chariot it can be moved
anywhere at will. The Assembly House has many rooms
and seats, and is adorned by celestial trees. Indra sits
there with his beautiful queen, wearing his crown, with
gleaming bracelets on his upper arms; he is decked with
flowers, and attired in white garments. He is waited
upon by brilliant Maruts, and all the gods and the rishis
and saints, whose sins have been washed off their pure
souls, which are resplendent as fire. There is no sorrow,
or fear, or suffering in Indra's abode, which is inhabited
by the spirits of wind and thunder, fire and water, plants
and clouds, and planets and stars, and the spirits also of
Prosperity, Religion, Joy, Faith, and Intelligence. Fairies
and elves (Apsaras and Gandharvas) dance and sing there
to sweet music; feats of skill are performed by celestial
battle heroes, auspicious rites are also practised. Divine
messengers come and go in celestial chariots, looking
bright as Soma himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;The heaven of Varuna was constructed by Vishwakarman
(Twashtri) within the sea. Its walls and arches
are of pure white, and they are surrounded by celestial
trees, made of sparkling jewels, which always blossom
and always bear fruit. In the many-coloured bowers
beautiful and variegated birds sing delightful melodies.
In the Assembly House, which is also of pure white,
there are many rooms and many seats. Varuna, richly
decked with jewels and golden ornaments and flowers, is
throned there with his queen. Adityas<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> wait upon the
lord of the waters, as also do hooded snakes (Nagas) with
human heads and arms, and Daityas and Danavas (giants
and demons) who have taken vows and have been rewarded
with immortality. All the holy spirits of rivers
and oceans are there, and the holy spirits of lakes and
springs and pools, and the personified forms of the points
of the heavens, the ends of the earth, and the great
mountains. Music and dances provide entertainment,
while sacred hymns are sung in praise of Varuna.&#8221;</p>

<p>These heavens recall the Grecian &#8220;Islands of the
Blest&#8221; and the Celtic Otherworld, where eternal summer
reigns, trees bear blossoms and fruit continually, and there
is no wasting with age. Indra's Assembly House is
slightly reminiscent of the Teutonic Valhal, but is really
more like the gardens of the underworld Hela. The
Indian heroes do not feast on pork like those of Teutonic
and Celtic myth; in the Assembly House of Kuvera, god
of wealth, however, fat and flesh are eaten by fierce
sentinel dwarfs. The fairy-like Apsaras are wooed by
Indra's favoured warriors as well as by the gods.</p>

<p>One of the conditions which secured entry to the
heaven of Yama was that a man should have offspring.
A rishi, named Mandapala, devoted himself to religious
vows and the observance of great austerities, but when he
reached the region of the Pitris, he could not obtain &#8220;the
fruit of his acts&#8221;. He asked: &#8220;Why is this domain
unattainable to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Said the Celestials: &#8220;Because thou hast no children....
The Vedas have declared that the son
rescueth the father from a hell called Put. O best of
Brahmans, strive thou to beget offspring.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>A father could only reach Heaven if his son, after
performing the cremation ceremony, poured forth the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
oblation and performed other necessary services to the
dead. Consequently, all men showed great anxiety to
have sons. In the Vedic period the exposure of female
children was not unknown; indeed, this practice is referred
to in the <i>Yajurveda</i>. &#8220;It is sorrowful to have a daughter,&#8221;
exclaims the writer of one of the <i>Brahmanas</i>.</p>

<p>One reason for infanticide in modern India is associated
with the practice of exogamy (marriage outside of one's
tribe). Raids took place for the purpose of obtaining
wives and these were invariably the cause of much bloodshed.
In 1842 members of the Kandhs tribe told Major
Macpherson &#8220;that it was better to destroy girls in their
infancy than to allow them to grow up and become causes
of strife afterwards&#8221;. Colonel MacCulloch, Political
Agent for Manipur, stamped out infanticide in the Naga
country by assuring the people of a tribe that they would
be protected against the wife-hunting parties of a stronger
tribe. &#8220;Many years afterwards a troop of Naga girls
from the weaker tribe paid a visit of ceremony to Colonel
MacCulloch, bearing presents of cloth of their own weaving
in token of their gratitude to the man who had saved
their lives.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>The gods are the Suras and the demons the Asuras or
&#8220;non-gods&#8221;. This distinction, however, did not obtain
in the early Vedic period. Originally the deities, and
especially Varuna and Mitra, were called Asuras, but in
the later part of the <i>Rigveda</i> the term is applied chiefly
to the enemies of the gods. In the <i>Atharvaveda</i>, as in
subsequent Epic literature, the Asuras are simply demons
and giants and goblins.</p>

<p>No conclusive explanation can be offered as to how
this remarkable change took place in the course of the
centuries embraced by the Vedic period. It may have
been due primarily to sectarian strife between the religious
teachers of those tribes which had been influenced by
Babylonian modes of thought and those which clung
tenaciously to the forms of primitive Aryan nature worship,
and perhaps also the worship of ancestors (Pitris).
In the old Persian language, which, like Greek, places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
&#8220;h&#8221; before a vowel where &#8220;s&#8221; is used in Sanskrit,
Ahura ( = Asura) signifies &#8220;god&#8221;. The Zoroastrian
chief god is called Ahura-Mazda, &#8220;the wise Lord&#8221;, as
Varuna is addressed in early Rigvedic hymns, &#8220;wise
Asura and King&#8221;, and &#8220;the all-knowing Asura who
established the heavens and fixed the limits of the earth&#8221;.
On the other hand &#8220;daeva&#8221; in the Iranian dialect, which
is cognate with Sanskrit &#8220;deva&#8221;, &#8220;god&#8221;, came to mean
&#8220;demon&#8221;. &#8220;Asura&#8221; is derived from the root &#8220;asu&#8221;,
which signifies &#8220;the air of life&#8221;, and &#8220;deva&#8221; from &#8220;div&#8221;,
&#8220;to shine&#8221;, or &#8220;deiwo&#8221;, &#8220;heavenly&#8221;.</p>

<p>The view has been urged that the revolt against
&#8220;Asura&#8221; in India was due to the hatred cherished towards
the Persians who had become subject to the
Assyrians, the worshippers of Ashur. It was originally
based on the assumption that Assyrian aggression caused
the migration of Aryan tribes towards India. Subsequent
research, however, has tended to dispel this theory.
It has been found, for instance, that Aryans were associated
with the Kassites who overthrew the Hammurabi
dynasty of Babylon prior to the invasion of the Punjab,
and that the Assyrians were for a period vassals of the
Mitanni kings, who had Aryan names and worshipped
Indra, Varuna, and Mithra in Mesopotamia and Asia
Minor. The weak point in the Ashur-Asura theory is
that it throws no light on the process which caused the
Persian &#8220;daeva&#8221; to be applied to demons instead of to
gods. How the gods of the Indian Aryans became the
demons of Persia and the demons of Persia became the
gods of India is a problem for which a solution has yet
to be found.</p>

<p>The expository and speculative books of the priests&mdash;the
<i>Brahmanas</i> and <i>Upanishads</i>&mdash;which are attached to
the Vedic hymns, do not help us greatly in accounting for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
the change. We read that &#8220;the gods and Asuras contended
together, and that the former, being less numerous
than the latter, took some bricks, and placing them in a
proper position to receive the sacrificial fire, with the
formula, &#8216;Thou art a multiplier&#8217;, they became numerous&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
In one of the Brahmanas we are informed:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;The Asuras performed at the sacrifice all that the Devas
performed. The Asuras became thus of equal power with the
Devas, and did not yet yield to them. Thereupon the Devas had
a vision of the &#8216;silent praise&#8217;. The Asuras, not knowing it, did
not perform the &#8216;silent praise&#8217;. This &#8216;silent praise&#8217; is the latent
essence of the hymns. Till then, whatever weapons the Devas
used against the Asuras, the Asuras used in revenge against them;
but when the Devas had a vision of the &#8216;silent praise&#8217; and raised
it as a weapon, the Asuras did not comprehend it. With it the
Devas aimed a blow at the Asuras, and defeated them, for they
had no comprehension of this weapon. Thereupon the Devas
became masters of the Asuras. He who has such a knowledge
becomes master of his enemy, adversary, and hater.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This explanation is but an echo of the Indra-Vritra
combat. Another statement is to the effect that &#8220;the
Devas gave up falsehood and adopted truth, while the
Asuras gave up truth and adopted falsehood&#8221;. Further,
we learn that when a sacrifice was performed the Asuras
put the offerings into their own mouths, while the Suras
(gods) gave the offerings they received to one another.</p>

<p>The Asuras became completely identified with the
demons and giants; they symbolized evil, darkness, and
drought. In Epic literature we read that &#8220;in ancient
times the gods and Asuras were very active in destroying
one another. And the terrible Asuras always succeeded
in defeating the gods.&#8221; ... Indra goes forth with

who wielded a great mace; this mace the demon hurled
against the god, but Indra &#8220;cut it up in its course with
his thunderbolt. Then Kesin, furious with rage, hurled
a huge mass of rock at him.&#8221; Indra &#8220;of a hundred sacrifices
rent it asunder with his thunderbolt, and it fell
down upon the ground. And Kesin himself was wounded
by that falling mass of rock.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Thus sorely afflicted he
fled&#8221;. Indra rescues a beautiful lady who had been
seized by the Asura, and she informs the god that her
sister had previously fallen a victim to the demon....<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>The Asuras obstructed sacrifices; they were ever
hovering round altars to discover if rites were properly
performed; if a priest did not perform a ceremony in
orthodox fashion, the sacrifice was of no avail, because
the Asuras devoured it; if a man neglected a part of a
ceremonial performance, a demon might take possession
of him and accomplish his ruin.</p>

<p>One of the terrible Asuras is the demon Rahu, who
causes eclipses by swallowing the sun and the moon, like
the Chinese dragon, the wolf Managarm of Teutonic
mythology, and the Grecian demons who devour Helena,
the sun maiden, sister of the twin Dioscuri. In the
Vedic period Rahu was represented by the demon Svarbhanu.</p>

<p>The Asuras of Ocean are the Daityas and Danavas,
the descendants of the chaos hags Diti and Danu, and
Kasyapa, a superhuman sage. These are the giants and
demons who fought against the gods like the Titans, the
Irish Fomorians, and the Norse Jotuns. Indra confined
them in this region, which is called Patala, and they remain
there &#8220;afflicted by Time&#8221;,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> and subject to the sway
of Varuna. Like the Norse giants, they will be let loose
to take part in the &#8220;Last Battle&#8221;. An &#8220;Asura fire&#8221;
burns constantly in Patala, fed by water; it is &#8220;bound
and confined&#8221;, but cannot be extinguished; when the
end of all comes, it will burst forth and burn up the
three worlds.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> In Teutonic mythology the Universe is
similarly doomed to be consumed by fire at Ragnarok,
&#8220;the Dusk of the Gods&#8221;.</p>

<p>The abodes of these giants and demons are exceedingly
beautiful; they are agleam with gold and precious
stones; seats and beds are provided in the mansions, and
there are also recreation grounds, and forests and mountains
resembling clouds. Indeed, the Daityas and Danavas
live pretty much in the same manner as the gods, for
&#8220;the gods and Danavas are brothers, although ever hostile
to one another&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> The Danava women are of gigantic
stature, and wear jewels as large as mountain boulders;
when terrified by the attacks of the gods, they &#8220;bewail
like unto cranes in Autumn&#8221;. One of the Daitya tribes
reside in the moving city named Hiranyapura, which they
constructed for their protection; sometimes it sinks below
the sea, or under the earth; at other times it soars across
the heavens like the sun. Indra, as we have seen, has
a similar aerial city.</p>

<p>In the Underworld dwell also the Nagas, the demoniac
Cobras; they are of human form to the waist,
the rest of their bodies being like those of serpents.
Their king is Shesha, who is also named Vasuki and
Karkotáka; he is sometimes represented with a thousand
heads, and resembles Typhon, who fought with Zeus. In
the <i>Ramayana</i> he is Ravana, the Demon of Ceylon. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>prototypes of Shesha and his hosts are the dragons Vritra,
&#8220;the encompasser&#8221;; Ahi, &#8220;the confiner&#8221;; and fierce
Kushna, &#8220;the scorcher&#8221;, who spits out the sunset fires
and burns up day.</p>

<p>When serpent worship became prevalent among the
Aryans, the Nagas were regarded as demigods. They
were occasionally &#8220;the friends of man&#8221;, and to those
they favoured they gave draughts of their nectar, which
endowed them with great strength. Their city was the
Paradise of serpent worshippers. The female Nagas
were beautiful nymphs, who were sometimes wooed by
mortals.</p>

<p>As the Asuras are the enemies of the gods, the
Rakshas or Rakshasas are the enemies of man.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> These
demons are &#8220;night prowlers&#8221;; they have greatest power
after &#8220;the first forty seconds of grey twilight preceding
nightfall&#8221;. They travel faster than the wind, and go
through the air; they have also power to change their
shape. Sometimes they appear in the guise of tigers,
bears, or great monkeys; and their hues vary from yellow
to red, and blue to green. In the <i>Ramayana</i> they are
found associated with the Asuras of Ceylon; a spy enters
a demon dwelling and sees them in all their shapes, some
frightfully deformed, with small bodies and long arms;
some as grotesque dwarfs, others as horrible giants with
long projecting teeth; some with one eye, others with
three eyes; some with one leg, two legs, or three, or
even four; and some with heads of serpents, horses, or
elephants. In the <i>Mahabharata</i> the Rakshasas are like
gorillas; they have arrow-shaped ears, big red eyes, and
red hair and beards, and mouths like caves; they feast
on human beings and cattle. The heroic Bhima, like
Siegfried Dietrich of Bern, Beowulf, and Finn-mac-Coul,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>is a mighty slayer of these man-eating demons. They
are impervious to weapons, but Bhima wrestles with them
and breaks their backs or tears them asunder, after lively
combats with trees and boulders. Female Rakshasas
sometimes fall in love with human beings, and transform
themselves into beautiful women. Bhima takes one for
his bride, and she carries him through the air to a Celestial
retreat among the mountains.</p>

<p>The most loathsome Rakshasas are the goblin-like
Pisachas,<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> who are devourers of dead bodies in cemeteries,
and are exceedingly vile and malignant fiends.
They are the bringers of diseases and wasting fevers.
In the <i>Atharvaveda</i> Agni is invoked by the priests, who
mutter charms over suffering and &#8220;possessed&#8221; mortals,
to take the Pisachas between his teeth and devour them.
They are &#8220;those who hound us in our chambers, while
shouting goes on in the night of the new moon ... the
flesh devourers, who plan to injure us, and whom I overcome&#8221;.
The priest declares: &#8220;I plague the Pisachas as
the tiger the cattle owners. As dogs who have seen a
lion, these do not find a refuge.... From villages I
enter Pisachas fly away.... May Nirriti (a goddess of
destruction) take hold of this one.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>Kali, a demon who holds friendly converse with the
gods in the &#8220;Story of Nala&#8221;, is attended by Dwápara,
a flesh-eater like the Pisachas. The Panis are aerial
demons, who are hated by bluff, honest Indra, because
they are the inspirers of foolish actions, slander, and
unbelief, and the imps who encourage men to neglect
homage to deities. The black Dasyus are repulsive of
aspect and jealous-hearted; they are the stealers of the
cloud cows who are held captive for Vritra in the cave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>of the demon Vala. The Darbas, &#8220;the tearers&#8221;, are a
variety of Pisachas. Reference is made in <i>Mahabharata</i>
to &#8220;ugly Vartikas of dreadful sight, having one wing, one
eye, and one leg&#8221;; when they &#8220;vomit blood, facing the
sun&#8221;, a dreadful happening is known to be at hand,
because they are fiends of evil omen.</p>

<p>Among the supernatural beings who are sometimes
the enemies, but in most cases the friends of mankind,
are the Yakshas, the Gandharvas, and the Apsaras (Apsarasas).</p>

<p>The Yakshas are occasionally referred to as the Punyajanas,
&#8220;the good people&#8221;; they may be of human stature,
with big benevolent eyes, or powerful giants who can fight
as fiercely as Rakshasas. They are guardians of hidden
treasure, like the dwarfs and giants of Teutonic legend,
being associated with Kuvera, god of wealth, whose abode
is situated among the Himalayan mountains. In Kuvera's
domain are found &#8220;multitudes of spirits&#8221; who do not visit
the world of men as a rule, but remain near the treasure
for purposes of defence; &#8220;some are of dwarfish stature,
some of fierce visage, some hunchbacked, some of blood-red
eyes, some of frightful yells; some are feeding upon
fat and flesh, and some are terrible to behold; and all are
armed with various weapons, and endued with the speed
of the wind&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>The Gandharvas are grouped in tribes, and number
over six thousand individuals. They are all of the male
sex. They haunt the air, the forests, and the mountains,
and, like the Rakshasas, have power to work illusions in
the grey twilight before nightfall. References are made
in the Epics to their combats with human beings. To
warriors who overcome them they impart instruction in
religious matters; those whom they conquer they carry
away, like the Teutonic elves and dwarfs. The Gandharvas
are renowned musicians and bards and singers.
When they play on their divine instruments the fairy-like
Apsaras, who are all females, dance merrily. In the
various Aryan heavens these elves and fairies delight and
allure with music and song and dance the gods, and the
souls of those who have attained to a state of bliss. The
Apsara dancing girls are &#8220;voluptuous and beautiful&#8221;, and
inspire love in Paradise as well as upon earth. Their
lovers include gods, Gandharvas, and mortals. Arjuna,
the human son of Indra, who was transported in a Celestial
chariot to Swarga over Suravithi, &#8220;the Milky Way&#8221;,
was enchanted by the music and songs and dances of the
Celestial elves and fairies. He followed bands of Gandharvas
who were &#8220;skilled in music sacred and profane&#8221;,
and he saw the bewitching Apsaras, including the notorious
Menaka, &#8220;with eyes like lotus blooms, employed in
enticing hearts&#8221;; they had &#8220;fair round hips and slim
waists&#8221;, and &#8220;began to perform various evolutions,
shaking their deep bosoms and casting their glances
around, and exhibiting other attractive attitudes capable
of stealing the hearts and resolutions and minds of the
spectators&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>In the <i>Rigveda</i> there is a water-nymph, named Apsaras;
she is the &#8220;spouse&#8221; of Gandharva, an atmospheric
deity who prepares Soma for the gods and reveals divine
truths to mortals. They vanish, however, in later times;
the other Vedas deal with the spirit groups which figure
so prominently in the Epics. No doubt the groups are
older than Gandharva, the god, and Apsaras, the goddess,
who may be simply the elf-king and the fairy-queen. The
&#8220;black&#8221; Dasyus are sometimes referred to by modern-day
writers as the dark aborigines who were displaced by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
Aryans; a tribal significance is also given to the Rakshasas
and the Gandharvas. But this tendency to identify the
creatures of the spirit world with human beings may be
carried too far. If &#8220;Dasyus&#8221; were really &#8220;dark folk&#8221;,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
it should be remembered that in Teutonic mythology
there are &#8220;black dwarfs&#8221;, who live in underground dwellings,
and &#8220;white elves&#8221; associated with air and ocean;
there are also black and white fairies in the Scottish Highlands,
so that black and white spirits may simply belong to
night and day spirit groups. It may be that the Indian
aborigines were referred to contemptuously as Dasyus by
the Aryans. The application of the names of repulsive
imps to human enemies is not an unfamiliar habit even
in our own day; in China the European is a &#8220;foreign
devil&#8221;, but Chinese &#8220;devils&#8221; existed long before Europeans
secured a footing in the Celestial Kingdom. Those
who seek for a rational explanation for the belief in
the existence of mythical beings should remember that
primitive man required no models for the creatures of his
fancy. He symbolized everything&mdash;his ideals, his desires,
his hopes and his fears, the howling wind, the low whispering
breeze, the creaking tree, the torrent, the river,
the lake, and the mountain; he heard the hammer or
the trumpet of a mighty god in the thunderstorm, he
believed that giants uprooted trees and cast boulders
down mountain slopes, that demons raised ocean billows
in tempest, and that the strife of the elements was a war
between gods and giants; day and night, ever in conflict,
were symbolized, as were also summer and winter, and
growth and decay. If the fairies and elves of Europe
are Lapps, or the small men of an interglacial period
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>in the Pleistocene Age, and if the Dasyus and Gandharvas
of India are merely Dravidians and pre-Dravidians who
resisted the Aryan invasion, who, then, it may be asked,
were the prototypes of the giants &#8220;big as mountains&#8221;,
or the demons like &#8220;trees walking&#8221;, the &#8220;tiger-headed&#8221;
Rakshasas, &#8220;ugly Vartikas&#8221; with &#8220;one wing, one eye,
and one leg&#8221;? and what animal suggested Vritra, or the
fiery dragon that burned up daylight, or Rahu, the
swallower of sun and moon? If the redhaired and red-bearded
Rakshasas are to be given a racial significance,
what of the blue Rakshasas and the green? The idea
that primitive man conceived of giants because he occasionally
unearthed the bones of prehistoric monsters, is
certainly not supported by Scottish evidence; Scotland
swarms with giants and hags of mountain, ocean, and
river, although it has not yielded any great skeletons or
even a single artifact of the Palæolithic Age. Giants and
fairies are creations of fancy. Just as a highly imaginative
child symbolizes his fears and peoples darkness with
terrifying monsters, so, it may be inferred, did primitive
man who crouched in his cave, or spent sleepless nights
in tempest-stricken forests, conceive with childlike mind
of demons thirsting for his blood and giants of wind
and fire intent on destroying the Universe.</p>

<p>In India, as elsewhere, the folk of the spirit world
might woo or be wooed by impressionable mortals. A
Gandharva related to Arjuna, the Pandava prince, by
whom he was defeated in single combat, the &#8220;charming
story&#8221;, as he called it, of King Samvarana and the fairy-like
Tapati, a daughter of the sun god, Surya. Tapati
was of all nymphs the most beautiful; she was &#8220;perfectly
symmetrical&#8221; and &#8220;exquisitely attired&#8221;; she had &#8220;faultless
features, and black, large eyes&#8221;; and, in contrast to
an Apsara, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> &#8220;was chaste and exceedingly well conducted&#8221;.
For a time the sun god considered that no
husband could be found who was worthy of his daughter;
and therefore &#8220;knew no peace of mind, always thinking
of the person he should select&#8221;. One day, however, King
Samvarana worshipped the sun, and made offerings of
flowers and sweet perfumes, and Surya resolved to bestow
his daughter upon this ideal man.</p>

<p>It came to pass that Samvarana went a-hunting deer
on the mountains. He rode swiftly in pursuit of a
nimble-footed stag, leaving his companions behind, until
his steed expired with exhaustion. Then he wandered
about alone. In a secluded wood he beheld a maiden of
exquisite beauty; he gazed at her steadfastly for a time,
thinking she was a goddess or &#8220;the embodiment of the
rays emanating from the sun&#8221;. Her body was as radiant
as fire and as spotless as the crescent moon; she stood
motionless like to a golden statue. The flowers and the
creepers round about partook of her beauty, and &#8220;seemed
to be converted into gold&#8221;. She was Tapati, daughter
of the sun.</p>

<p>The king's eyes were captivated, his heart was wounded
by the arrows of the love god Kama; he lost his peace of
mind. At length he spoke and said: &#8220;Who art thou, O
fair one? O maiden of sweet smiles, why dost thou linger
in these lonely woods? I have never seen or heard of
one so beautiful as thee.... The love god tortures
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>That lotus-eyed maiden made no answer; she vanished
from sight like to lightning in the clouds.</p>

<p>The king hastened through the forest, lamenting for
her: he searched in vain; he stood motionless in grief;
he fell down on the earth and swooned.</p>

<p>Then, smiling sweetly, the maiden appeared again.
In honeyed words she spoke, saying:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> &#8220;Arise, thou tiger
among kings. It is not meet that thou shouldst lose thy
reason in this manner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Samvarana opened his eyes and beheld Tapati. Weak
with emotion he spoke and said: &#8220;I am burning with
love for thee, thou black-eyed beauty, O accept me.
My life is ebbing away.... I have been bitten by Kama,
who is even like a venomous snake. Have mercy on
me.... O thou of handsome and faultless features, O
thou of face like unto the lotus or the moon, O thou of
voice sweet as that of singing Kinnaras, my life now
depends on thee. Without thee, O timid one, I am
unable to live. It behoveth thee not, O black-eyed maid,
to cast me off; it behoveth thee to relieve me from this
affliction by giving me thy love. At the first sight thou
hast distracted my heart. My mind wandereth. Be
merciful; I am thy obedient slave, thy adorer. O accept
me.... O thou of lotus eyes, the flame of desire
burneth within me. O extinguish that flame by throwing
on it the water of thy love....&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>Tapati replied: &#8220;I am not mistress of mine own self.
I am a maiden ruled by my father. If thou dost love
me, demand me of him. My heart hath been robbed by
thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, revealing her identity, Tapati ascended to
heaven, and once again Samvarana fell upon the earth
and swooned.</p>

<p>The ministers and followers of the king came searching
for him, and found him &#8220;lying forsaken on the ground
like a rainbow dropped from the firmament&#8221;. They
sprinkled his face with cool and lotus-scented water.
When he revived, the monarch sent away all his followers
except one minister. For twelve days he worshipped
the sun constantly on the mountain top. Then a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Rishi, whom he had sent for, came to him, and the Rishi
ascended to the sun. Ere long he returned with Tapas,
the sun god having declared that Varanasi would be
a worthy husband for his daughter.</p>

<p>For twelve years the king lived with his fairy bride
in the mountain forests, and a regent ruled over the
kingdom.</p>

<p>But although the monarch enjoyed great bliss, living
the life of a Celestial, the people of the kingdom suffered
greatly. For twelve years no rain fell, &#8220;not even a drop
of dew came from the skies, and no corn was grown&#8221;.
The people were afflicted with famine; men grew reckless,
and deserted their wives and children; the capital became
like to a city of the dead.</p>

<p>Then a great Rishi brought Varanasi back to his
capital with his Celestial bride. And after that things
became as they were before. Rain fell in abundance and
corn was grown. &#8220;Revived by that foremost of monarchs
of virtuous soul, the capital and the country became glad
with exceeding joy.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> A son was born to the king, and
his name was Kuru.</p>

<p>There are many other uncatalogued Celestial beings
like Tapati in Indian fairyland. In the <i>Atharva-veda</i>
there are numerous named and nameless spirits of good
and evil, and throughout the Epics references are made to
semi-divine beings who haunt streams, lakes, forests, and
plains. A <i>Rigveda</i> hymn is addressed to the forest nymph
Aranyani. She echoes the voices of man and beast and
creates illusions:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She mimics kine that crop the grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She rumbles like a cart at even,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
<span class="i0">She calls The cow, she hews down wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The man who lingers says, &#8220;Who calleth?&#8221;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O Aranyani will not harm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If one will not invade her dwelling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, having eaten luscious fruit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At her sweet will she turns to slumber.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The singing birds are all singing spirits in India as
in Europe. The &#8220;language of birds&#8221; is the language of
spirits. When Siegfried, after eating of the dragon's
heart, understood the &#8220;language of birds&#8221;, he heard
them warning him regarding his enemies. Our seafarers
whistle when they invoke the spirit of the wind. Sir
Walter Scott drew attention, in his <i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish
Border</i>, to the belief that the speech of spirits was a kind
of whistling. As we have seen, the wives of Danavas
had voices like Cranes; Homer's ghosts twittered like
bats; Egyptian ghosts were hooting owls. In India the
croaking raven is still a bird of evil omen, as it is also in
the West. In the Scottish Highlands the spirits of the
dead sometimes appear as birds; so do fairies. The Irish
gods and the Celestial Rishis of India take the form of
swans, like the &#8220;swan maidens&#8221;, when they visit mankind.
In the Assyrian legend of Ishtar the souls of the
dead in Hades &#8220;are like birds covered with feathers&#8221;.
Numerous instances could be quoted to illustrate the
widespread association of birds with the spirit world.</p>

<p>During the Vedic Age, which came to a close in the
eighth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, the Aryan settlers spread gradually
eastward and southward. At first they occupied the
Punjab, but ere the Rigvedic period was ended they had
reached the banks of the Jumna and the Ganges in the
&#8220;Middle Country&#8221;. In the early hymns the great
Himalayan mountains dominate fertile river valleys, but
the greater part of northern India is covered by vast and
dense forests. No mention is made of the sea.</p>

<p>The Aryans were a pastoral and hunting people, with
some knowledge of agriculture. They possessed large
herds of cattle, and had also sheep, goats, and asses; they
were, besides, famous breeders and tamers of horses; the
faithful dog, man's earliest friend, followed both herdsman
and hunter. The plough was in use, and bullocks
were yoked to it; grain was thrashed in primitive manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
and ground between &#8220;pounding stones&#8221;. Barley and
wheaten cakes, milk, curds, butter, and cheese, and wild
fruits were the chief articles of diet; the products of the
chase were also eaten, but there appears to have been at
the earliest period a restriction in the consumption of
certain foods. Beef was not eaten at meals. Bulls were
sacrificed to the gods. Two kinds of intoxicating liquors
were brewed&mdash;the mysterious Soma, beloved by deities,
and a mead or ale called &#8220;sura&#8221;, the Avestan &#8220;hura&#8221;,
prepared probably from grain, which had ever an evil
reputation as a cause of peace-breaking, like dice, and
of wrongdoing generally.</p>

<p>Metals were in use, for the earliest Aryan invasion
took place in the Bronze Age, during which there were
great race movements and invasions and conquests in
Asia and in Europe. It is doubtful whether or not iron
was known by the earliest Aryan settlers in India; it was
probably not worked, but may have been utilized for
charms, as in those countries in which meteoric iron was
called &#8220;the metal of heaven&#8221;. The knowledge of the
mechanical arts had advanced beyond the primitive stage.
Warriors fought not only on foot but also in chariots, and
they wore breastplates; their chief weapons were bows
and horn or metal-tipped arrows, maces, battleaxes,
swords, and spears. Smiths roused their fires with feather
fans; carpenters are mentioned in the hymns, and even
barbers who used razors.</p>

<p>The father was the head of the family, and the family
was the tribal unit. War was waged by a loose federation
of small clans, each of which was distinguished by the
name of a patriarch. The necessity of having to conduct
frequent campaigns in a new country, peopled by hostile
aliens, no doubt tended to weld tribal units into small
kingdoms and to promote the monarchic system. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
intertribal feuds were frequent and bitter. The Aryans
of the Punjab, like the Gauls who settled in northern
Italy, and the clans of the Scottish Highlands in the
Middle Ages, were continually divided among themselves,
and greatly occupied in subduing rivals and in
harrying their cattle.</p>

<p>Villages were protected by stockades or earthworks
against the attacks of enemies and wild beasts, or they
contained strongholds. They were governed by headsmen,
who were, no doubt, military leaders also; disputes
were settled by a judge. Land, especially grazing land,
appears to have been held in common by communities,
but there are indications that cultivated plots and houses
were owned by families and ultimately by individuals, the
father in such cases being the supreme authority. Village
communities, however, might be migratory, and certain
of them may have had seasonal areas of settlement.</p>

<p>Permanent villages existed in groups and also at some
distance from one another, and were connected by roads,
and one clan might embrace several separate communities.
Trade was conducted by barter, the cow being the standard
of value, but in time jewels and gold ornaments were
used like money for purchases; &#8220;nishka&#8221;, a necklet,
afterwards signified a coin. Foreign traders were not
unknown at an early period. The use of alphabetic signs
appears to have been introduced by Semites before the
close of the Vedic period; from these evolved ultimately
the scientific Sanskrit alphabet and grammar.</p>

<p>In the Iranian period<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> there were social divisions of
the people, but the hereditary system does not appear to
have obtained until the close of Rigvedic times. Kings
might be elected, or a military aristocracy might impose
its sway over an area; a priest was originally a poet or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>leader of thought, or a man of elevated character, like the
Scottish Highland <i>duine-usual</i>, the &#8220;upwardly man&#8221;, who
might be the son of a chief or of the humblest member of
a community.</p>

<p>The earliest Aryan divisions of society were apparently
marked by occupations. At first there were three grades:
warriors, priests, and traders, but all classes might engage
in agricultural pursuits; even in the Epic period princes
counted and branded cattle. In the later Vedic age, however,
a rigid system of castes came into existence, the
result, apparently, of having to distinguish between Aryans
and aborigines at first, and subsequently between the
various degrees of Aryans who had intermarried with
aliens. Caste (Varna) signifies colour, and its relation to
occupation is apparent in the four divisions&mdash;Brahmans,
priests; Kshatriyas, the military aristocracy; Vaisyas, commoners,
workers, and traders, who were freemen; and
Sudras, slaves and aborigines. In the <i>Yajurveda</i>, the
third Veda, the caste system is found established on a
hereditary basis. The three upper castes, which were composed
of Aryans only, partook in all religious ceremonials,
but the members of the Sudra caste were hedged about
by severe restrictions. The knowledge of the Vedas was
denied to them, and they were not allowed to partake of
Soma offerings, and although in the process of time their
position improved somewhat in the religious life of the
mingled people, their social inferiority was ever emphasized;
they might become traders, but never Kshatriyas or
Brahmans.</p>

<p>The most renowned of early Brahmans were the
Rishis, the poets<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> who composed the &#8220;new songs&#8221; to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>gods. They were regarded as divinely inspired men and
their fame was perpetuated after death. Several renowned
poets are referred to in sacred literature and invested with
great sanctity. The hymns or mantras were committed
to memory and then handed down from generation to
generation. At religious ceremonies these were chanted
by reciters, the Hotri priests. There were also priests
who were skilled in the correct performance of sacrificial
rites, and family priests, the Purohitas, who were the
guides, philosophers, and friends of kings and noblemen.
A Rishi might be a Purohita and a seer, who ensured by
the performance of mystic ceremonies a monarch's success
in battle and afterwards celebrated his achievements in
song.</p>

<p>In the process of time an organized priesthood came
into existence, and a clan or kingdom had its chief priest.
The production of new hymns came to an end; those
which existed were considered sufficient for all purposes;
religious beliefs were systematized, and an arbitrary ritual
became more and more complicated.</p>

<p>There are indications that at an early period a chief or
king might offer up a sacrifice, but when the profession
of the Brahman became hereditary, no rite could be performed
unless presided over by holy men. A sacrifice
might be rendered futile by an error in the construction
of an altar, or in the order of ceremonial practices, or by
failure to select appropriate chants. The Asuras and
Rakshasas and other demons were ever hovering round
the altar, endeavouring to obstruct ceremonies and to
take advantage of ritualistic errors to intercept offerings
intended for the gods. It was by making sacrifices that
man was believed to obtain power over the gods, or
magical control over the forces of nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>For the performance of some sacrifices a day of preparation
might be required. Altars had to be erected
with mathematical exactness; the stones were blessed and
anointed; offerings were made at every stage of the work
so that the various deities might give protection in their
various spheres. The following extract from one of the
Brahmanas affords a glimpse of the preparatory rites:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Thrice he (the priest) perambulates it (the altar); for thrice he
walks round it (whilst sprinkling); thus as many times as he walks
round it, so many times does he perambulate it....</p>

<p>Having thereupon put that stone into the water pitcher, (he)
throws it in that (south-westerly) direction, for that is Nirriti's
region; he thus consigns pain to Nirriti's region....</p>

<p>Outside the fire altars he throws it, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Human failings may be imputed to Brahmans, but it
must be recognized that the ideals of their caste were of
a high order. They were supposed to be born with
&#8220;spiritual lustre&#8221;, and their lives were consecrated to the
instruction and uplifting of mankind and the attainment
of salvation. A Brahman's life was divided into four
periods. The first was the period of childhood, and the
second was the period of probation, when he went to live
in a forest hermitage, where he acted as the servant of a
revered old sage, his spiritual father, and received instruction
in Brahmanic knowledge for a number of years.
During the third period the Brahman lived the worldly
life; he married and reared a family and performed the
duties pertaining to his caste. Hospitality was one of
the chief worldly duties; if a stranger, even although he
might be an enemy, came and asked for food he received
it, although the Brahman family should have to fast to
supply him. In the fourth period the Brahman, having
proved himself a faithful husband and exemplary father,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>divided his worldly possessions between his grown-up
sons and daughters; then he abandoned his comfortable
home and, assuming the deerskin clothing of hermits,
went to live in a lonely forest, or among the Himalayan
mountains, to prepare for the coming of death, far away
from the shadows cast by sin and sorrow. In solitude
he performed rigid penances and addressed himself with
single-minded devotion to the contemplation of spiritual
problems. Subduing the five senses, he attained to the
state of Yoga (concentration). Placing his mind entirely
upon the contemplation of the soul, he became united
ultimately with the World Soul (God), thus obtaining
the release which was Salvation. Some Brahmans were
teachers who instructed pupils and composed the sacred
writings. The forest hermitages were the universities of
ancient India.</p>

<p>The profession of the priesthood had certainly its
mercenary aspect; sacrificial fees were fixed as well as
sacrificial rites, and a not unimportant part of a ceremony
was the offering of generous gifts to the Brahmans, who
presided at the altar. But on the whole the riches thus
expended were not given in vain. As in Egypt, the rise
and endowment of the priestly cult was due to the accumulation
of wealth which enabled a section of society to find
leisure for study and the promotion of culture. Aryan
civilization in India owed much to the Brahmans. They
introduced and elaborated alphabetic signs; the devoted
scholars among them compiled the first Sanskrit grammar
and studied the art of composition. Among the hermits
there were great and original thinkers who laid the basis
of Indian metaphysical thought, and rose from the
materialism of the early Vedic hymns to the idealism of
the speculative prose works, which included the <i>Forest
Books</i>, a name redolent of leafy solitude and of simple
and contemplative lives on the banks of sweetly-flowing
waters. Even their devotion to the mysteries of sacrificial
ritual, which became more and more complicated,
was not unproductive of permanent benefits to mankind.
The necessity for the exact construction of altars, and the
observance of ceremonies in due season, promoted the
study of mathematical science. These Brahmans invented
the numerical figures which have attained universal usage,
and in time they gave the world Algebra. The influence
of their culture may be traced in other directions. At the
present day it has indirectly brought into existence the
science of Comparative Religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>At the close of the Rigvedic period the Aryans had
extended their sway to the district known as Madhyadesa,
the &#8220;middle country&#8221;, between the &#8220;Five Rivers&#8221; of
the Punjab and the upper reaches of the Jumna and
Ganges. Pioneers were meantime pressing southward
and eastward towards the sea. Migrations were, no
doubt, due to propulsion as well as attraction; fresh folk-waves
probably poured in periodically from the north-west,
while the settled population must have increased
rapidly in the fertile land controlled by the invaders, to
whom the aborigines offered but slight resistance.</p>

<p>The second Vedic book, the <i>Samaveda</i>, does not contain
much fresh material: it is mainly a compilation of the
Rigvedic hymns which the priests chanted at the Soma
sacrifice. Its sole interest, from a historical point of view,
is the evidence it affords of the steady growth of ritualistic
tendencies. A new era of Aryan civilization is revealed,
however, by the third Veda, the <i>Yajurveda</i>. In this book
the tribes are found to have extended their area of control
down the Ganges valley, and southward along the banks
of the Indus. It is of interest to note here that the word
&#8220;Samudra&#8221;, first applied to the broadening Indus where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
it receives its tributaries, and signifying &#8220;collected waters&#8221;,
became in the <i>Brahmanas</i> the name of the world-encircling
ocean, across which in due time loomed the ships which
&#8220;once in three years&#8221; carried to Solomon's order &#8220;gold,
and silver, ivory (or elephants' tusks), and apes, and peacocks&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>In the <i>Yajurveda</i> we find that Aryan civilization has
developed greatly in the course of three or four centuries.
Powerful tribes have established kingdoms, and small
states are being subjected to the larger. The hardened
system of social organization is reflected by the references
to the four distinct castes. Hitherto the Kshatriyas have
controlled the destinies of the people, but now the Brahmans
achieve an intellectual conquest and impose their
sway over kings and nobles. The holy men are no
longer the humble servants of generous patrons; they are
the human representatives of the all-controlling deities.
&#8220;Verily, there are two kinds of gods; for the gods themselves,
assuredly, are gods, and those priests who have
studied and teach Vedic lore, are the human gods.&#8221;</p>

<p>The offerings to the deities are &#8220;consecrated by the
feeding of priests&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>Even the gods become dependent upon the priests,
who provided them by offering sacrifices with the &#8220;food&#8221;
they required, and also with the Soma which gave them
length of years. Indra could not combat against the
Asuras without the assistance of the priests who chanted
formulas to ensure victory; it was, therefore, due to the
power exercised, in the first place, by the priests that the
drought demon was overcome and rain fell in abundance.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>Priests might also accumulate in heaven credit balances
of Celestial power by undergoing penances for long periods.
A heavy debt was also due to them by the gods for their
sacrificial offerings. When a Brahman desired to exercise
his accumulated power, he might even depose the deities,
who were therefore placed under compulsion to fulfil his
demands; his Celestial credit might exceed the &#8220;paying&#8221;
possibilities of the supreme Powers. In the sacred tales
Brahmans were credited with performing rigid penances
for centuries.</p>

<p>In the fourth Veda, the <i>Atharva-veda</i>, the revival of
belief in formulas is emphasized. This book, which did
not receive recognition as an inspired work at first, is in
the main a collection of metrical charms of great antiquity.
Many resemble closely those which have been collected
by folk-lorists during late years in the Scottish Highlands
and elsewhere throughout Europe. The Rigveda hymns
reveal the religious beliefs and aspirations of the advanced
thinkers of their age; the <i>Atharva-veda</i> contains the germs
of folk religion&mdash;the magical formulas chanted to dispel
or invoke the vague spirits who helped or thwarted mankind.
It teaches that the Universe is upheld by sacrifice
and the spiritual exaltation of Brahmans, and that Brahmanic
power may be exercised by the use of appropriate
charms. Human beings might also be influenced by the
spirits invoked by means of formulas.</p>

<p>Primitive man believed that all emotions were caused
by spirits. When the poet sang, he was &#8220;inspired&#8221;&mdash;he
drew in a spirit; ecstasy was &#8220;a standing outside of oneself&#8221;,
the soul having escaped temporarily from the body.
Wrath was caused by a demon, and &#8220;battle fury&#8221; by
the spirit of war which possessed the warrior. When a
human being was &#8220;seized&#8221; by a fit, his convulsions were
believed to be caused by the demon who had entered his
body. Love was inspiration in the literal sense, and an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
Indian lover might compel a heedless lady to regard him
with favour by reciting an Atharva-vedic spell. Apparently
the love spirit had a weakness for honey. The
lover chanted:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Honey be mine at the tip of my tongue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May sweetness of honey pervade my speech,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that my love may come under my spell&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that my lady may yield to my will.<br /></span>
</div>
<p class="poematrib"><i>Atharva-veda</i>, i, 34.</p>
</div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As the grass is shorn from earth by the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So may thy soul be shorn to my will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then, O lady, thou'lt give me thy love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor be averse to me as thou wert.<br /></span>
</div>
<p class="poematrib"><i>Atharva-veda</i>, ii, 30.</p>
</div>

<p>A lover, we find, can invoke the lady to embrace him
&#8220;as the creeper embraces a tree&#8221;; if she clings to his
arm he can cause her to cling to his heart; his influence
over her mind is like the influence of a wing-beating eagle
over the wind. It may be, too, that a neglected girl finds
it necessary to prepare a love potion with &#8220;salve, sweet
wood, and spikenard&#8221;, and to cause the heart of an ungallant
swain to suffer from &#8220;a parching heart&#8221;, which
&#8220;languishes for love&#8221;, and experiences the &#8220;yearning of
the Apsaras&#8221;.</p>

<p>Warriors were charmed against spells, cattle and sheep
were charmed against wild beasts, a house was charmed
against evil spirits and demons.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Greedy demons of disease,

feared: Brahmans performed ceremonies of riddance and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
&#8220;plagued them as the tiger plagues the cattle owners&#8221;.
The following is a charm against cough:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As the soul with the soul's desires swiftly to a distance flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus do thou, O cough, fly forth along the soul's course of flight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a well-sharpened arrow swiftly to a distance flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus do thou, O cough, fly forth along the expanse of the earth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the rays of the sun swiftly to a distance fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus do thou, O cough, fly forth along the flood of the sea.<br /></span>
</div>
<p class="poematrib"><i>Atharva-veda</i>, vi, 105.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>
</div>

<p>A Scottish Highland charm similarly invokes the
Powers, or the &#8220;King of the Elements&#8221;:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To cause the wrath of men to ebb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like to a wave from the sea to the floodtide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a wave from the floodtide to the ebb.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Occasionally a mantra is infused with high religious
fervour. A Brahman might pray:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>From the sins which knowingly or unknowingly we have
committed, do ye, all gods, of one accord release us.</p>

<p>If awake or asleep, to sin inclined, I have committed a sin,
may what has been, and what shall be, as if from a wooden post,
release me.</p></blockquote>

<p>Another hymn of this character concludes:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In heaven, where our righteous friends are blessed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Having cast off diseases from their bodies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From lameness free and not deformed in members,<br /></span>

<p>While the tribes were spreading southward and eastward,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>Madhyadesa, the &#8220;middle country&#8221;, remained the
centre of Brahmanic culture. In that district came into
existence the earliest sacred prose works which constitute
the basis of classic Hinduism. The first were the oldest
<i>Brahmanas</i>; these comment on and expound the doctrines
of the Vedic hymns, especially in their relation to the
ritual of sacrifices. To the <i>Brahmanas</i> were added the
<i>Aran´yakas</i>, &#8220;forest books&#8221;, which are more speculative in
tendency. The expository appendices to the <i>Aran´yakas</i>
are called the <i>Upanishads</i>, &#8220;the sittings down&#8221;, or &#8220;the
sessions&#8221;&mdash;the pupil sat at his master's feet&mdash;and in
these a high level of thought is attained. &#8220;For the first
time&#8221;, says Professor Macdonell, &#8220;we find the Absolute
grasped and proclaimed.&#8221;</p>

<p>All the tribes were not infused with the same degree
of culture. In the <i>Yajur-veda</i> period there were various
schools of thought, and these continued to exercise their
influence into historic times, even after Upanishadic doctrines
became widespread.</p>

<p>Ere we deal, however, with the new theological
doctrines of the Brahmanic teachers, we should follow
the development of sacrificial practices, because from
these evolved the bold Pantheism which characterized
the conception of the World Soul, Brahm&#259;.</p>

<p>The two greatest sacrifices were the <i>purusha-medha</i>,
the human sacrifice, and <i>aswa-medha</i>, the sacrifice of the
horse. Both were prevalent in early times, and in
simpler form than they survive to us in the doctrinal
works and the Epics. A human sacrifice was believed
to be of highest potency, but it became extremely rare,
as in Egypt, among the ruling and cultured classes. It
was perpetuated in India, however, until about half a
century ago, by the Dravidian Khonds in Bengal and
Madras, and had to be suppressed by British officers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
Human sacrifices, in historic times, were &#8220;offered to the
earth goddess, Tari Pennu or Bera Pennu, and were
believed to ensure good crops, and immunity from all
diseases and accidents&#8221;. One official record states that
the victim, after being stabbed by the priest, was
&#8220;literally cut to pieces&#8221;. Each person who was &#8220;so
fortunate as to procure it carried away a morsel of the
flesh, and presented it to the idol of his own village&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>From the practice of sacrificing human beings arose
the conception that the first act of Creation was, if not
human sacrifice, at least the sacrifice of the first being
with human attributes. The Universe is the giant
Purusha (&#8220;man&#8221;); he is &#8220;all that hath been and shall
be&#8221;. In a Rigvedic hymn, which is regarded as being
of later composition than the Rigvedic period, it is set
forth:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;When the gods performed a sacrifice with Purusha as the
oblation, the Spring was its butter, the Summer its fuel, and the
Autumn its (accompanying) offering. This victim, Purusha, born
in the beginning, they immolated on the sacrificial grass.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>From this universal sacrifice issued forth all that
exists. The Brahman rose from Purusha's mouth, the
Rajanya (Kshatriya) from his arms, the Vaisya from his
thighs, and the Sudra sprang from his feet. Indra and
Agni came from his mouth, and Vayu from his breath.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;When the gods, performing sacrifice, bound Purusha as a
victim, there were seven sticks (stuck up) for it (around the fire).... With
sacrifice the gods performed the sacrifice. These were
the earliest rites.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;From his (Purusha's) navel arose the air, from his
head the sky, from his ears the four quarters; in this
manner (the gods) formed the worlds.&#8221; This conception
resembles closely the story in Teutonic mythology
of the cutting up by the gods of the body of the chaos
giant Ymer; his skull became the sky, his bones the
rocks, his blood the sea, and so on. One of the Chinese
P'an Ku<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> myths is of similar character; the world is composed
of different parts of his body. The Babylonian
Merodach also divided the body of the chaos demon,
Tiawath or Tiamat; her head became the sky, her body
the earth, and her blood the rivers which fill the sea.
Purusha, the chaos giant of India, had &#8220;a thousand
heads, a thousand eyes, and a thousand feet&#8221;; the earth
was equal to the space covered by ten of his fingers; he
was &#8220;the whole universe&#8221;.</p>

<p>The horse sacrifice was also infused, like the human
sacrifice, with symbolic significance. It was probably
practised in the early Iranian period by the Aryan horse
tamers, who may have substituted man's fleet-footed
friend for human beings. The Mongolian Buriats in the
vicinity of Lake Baikal, Siberia, are the latest surviving
sacrificers of the domesticated animal. Their horse sacrifice
(Tailgan) was held on 2 August on a sacred hill
inhabited by their gods, the Burkans, &#8220;the masters&#8221;.
The horse was bound, thrown upon its back and held
tightly by ropes, while the officiating person cut open
its breast and pulled out the pulsating heart like the
sacrificers of human beings in Ancient Mexico. The
animal's bones were burned on the altars, and the flesh
was cooked and devoured by the worshippers. Portions
of the flesh, and some of the broth prepared, were given
to the flames, which also received libations of the liquor
called <i>tarasun</i>, distilled from sour milk. <i>Tarasun</i> was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
the Soma of the Buriats, and their fire spirit was, like the
Indian Agni, a ready drinker of it. Bits of food were
also flung to aerial spirits, while oblations were poured
on the hill, the belief prevailing that these offerings
multiplied sufficiently to permit of the gods feeding
sumptuously. As each of the worshippers of the spirits
of nature accepted a portion of sacrificial food, a prayer
was chanted, entreating the gods to cause increase of all
things.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let our villages be one verst longer,&#8221; they said;
&#8220;create cattle in our enclosures; under our blankets
create a son; send down rain from high heaven to us;
cause much grass to grow; create so much grain that the
sickle cannot raise it, and so much grass that the scythe
cannot cut it.&#8221;</p>

<p>After the sacrifice, the food was divided and the fragments
that remained were carefully burned, &#8220;for none
of it must be eaten by dogs; that would be desecration,
and misfortune would follow in its wake&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>The purpose of this annual sacrifice was evidently to
secure fertility and prosperity generally, and we refer
to it here so fully because of the light it throws on the
Indian ceremonial which it resembles closely in some of
its details.</p>

<p>There are two direct references to the horse sacrifice
in the <i>Rigveda</i>.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> The animal is &#8220;covered with rich
trappings&#8221; and led thrice round the altar. It is accompanied
by a goat, which is killed first to &#8220;announce the
sacrifice to the gods&#8221;. A goat was also slain at a burial
to inform the gods that the soul was about to enter
Heaven.</p>

<p>In the <i>Story of Nala</i> and in the <i>Ramáyana</i>, the horse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>sacrifice is performed to secure human offspring. A
second <i>Ramáyana</i> horse sacrifice is offered as an atonement
after the slaying of the demon Ravana. An elaborate
account of this great ceremonial is also given in the
<i>Mahábhárata</i>. It was performed after &#8220;the great war&#8221;
on the advice of the sage Vyasa to atone for the slaying
of kinsmen. The horse was let loose and an army
followed it. Whichever country the animal entered had
to be conquered for the owner of the horse, so that only
a powerful monarch could fulfil the conditions of the
sacrifice. A hundred such sacrifices might enable a king
to depose Indra.</p>

<p>It is significant, however, that the animal was released
to wander from kingdom to kingdom on the
night of the full moon in the spring month of Choitro,
and that it returned in the following year at the close
of the winter season. When the ground was prepared
by being ploughed by the king, the queen followed
him, sowing the seeds of every kind of vegetable and
curative herb which grew in the kingdom. A countless
number of representative animals were sacrificed before
the sacred horse was slain, the rain drum and trumpet
were sounded, and the king and queen were drenched
with holy water.</p>

<p>The flesh of the horse was cooked and eaten, and
Indra and the other gods appeared and partook of their
portions. Pieces were also flung in the fire, and the fire
received also its meed of Soma. When the sacrifice was
completed, the king divided the herb offerings among
the people; what remained over was burned.</p>

<p>In the <i>Mahábhárata</i> a white horse is sacrificed, but
in the <i>Ramáyana</i> a black victim is offered up. White
horses were sacrificed to Mars by the Romans; the
Greeks sacrificed white horses to the sun by throwing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
them in the sea; the Spartans offered up their horses,
like the Buriats, on a hilltop.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that the Greek and Roman
horse sacrifices were also intended to ensure fertility.
A horse was offered up to Diana at the August harvest
festival, and we know that that popular goddess gave
plentiful crops and was the guardian of flocks and herds
and wild animals of the chase; she also presided at birth,
and women invoked her aid. Virgins and youths took
a prominent part at this harvest festival. The Roman
horse sacrifice took place on 15 October. The animal
was offered to Mars; the head was conveyed to the
king's house<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> and decorated with loaves, and the blood
was preserved until April, when it was mixed by virgins
with the blood of calves; this mixture was given to
shepherds to ensure the increase of flocks which were
fumigated. In the <i>Mahábhárata</i> the king and the princes
stand for a time in the smoke belching from the altar,
to be cleansed of their sins.</p>

<p>The Persians, and other peoples of Aryan speech and
custom, sacrificed horses regularly. But the custom was
not confined to Indo-Europeans. The Scythians,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> who
were probably Mongols, not only offered horses to the
Spirit of Fertility, but also, like the Buriats, to the dead.
The Patagonians sacrificed horses to tree spirits. In this
connection it may be noted that some European horse
sacrifices took place in sacred groves; the Buriats tied
their horse to a birch tree, which was carried to the
mountain top and fixed to a stake; the Indian sacrificial
posts were probably substitutes for trees.</p>

<p>In the <i>Upanishads</i> the sacrifice of the horse is infused,
as we have indicated, with mystic symbolism. We read:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
&#8220;The dawn in truth is the head of the sacrificial horse.
The sun is the eye; the wind the breath ... the year
the body, the heaven is the back ... the constellations
the bones; the sky the muscles; the rivers, arteries and
veins; the liver and spleen, the mountains; the herbs
and trees, the various kinds of hair.&#8221; The horse is
also identified with the sun: &#8220;The sun, as long as he
rises is the fore part of the body; the sun, as long as he
descends is the hind part of the body, &amp;c.&#8221; The horse
is also day and night in turn, and its birthplace is the
sea; it carries the gods and the Asuras; it is the symbol
of Death, &#8220;who is voracity&#8221;, from whom all things
came. &#8220;There was not anything here before.&#8221; Death
first &#8220;created this mind, desiring, <i>May I have a soul</i>.
He went forth worshipping. From him, when worshipping,
the waters were produced.... The froth of
the waters which was there became consistent. This
became the earth.... He made himself threefold.
His eastern quarter is the head ... his western quarter
is the tail, &amp;c.&#8221;</p>

<p>The work of Creation proceeds, and then &#8220;he (Death
as the Creator) resolved to devour all that he had created;
for he eats all.... He is the eater of the whole universe;
this whole universe is his food.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a year of purification the Creator slaughtered
his horse body. &#8220;He gave up the animal to the gods.
Therefore they (the gods) slaughter the purified animal,
representing in its nature, as Prajápati, all deities. He
(the Creator) is the Ashwameda<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> who shines.&#8221;</p>

<p>The gods performed the sacrifice to overcome the
demons, the representatives of sin. Therefore the horse
sacrifice removes all sin.</p>

<p>After much fantastic symbolism the following lesson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
in the form of a mantra is extracted from the parable of
Creation:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;From the unreal lead me to the real, from darkness lead me
to light, from death lead me to immortality.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The Upanishadic treatment of the Purusha myth
differs somewhat from the Vedic, and is intended to
strengthen the Monotheistic tendencies displayed in some
of the hymns.</p>

<p>When the Universal soul, according to this later
doctrine, took at the beginning &#8220;the shape of a man&#8221; ...
he &#8220;beheld nothing but himself&#8221;.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;He said first <i>This, I am</i>. Hence the name of &#8216;I&#8217; was produced.
Therefore, even now a man, when called, says first, &#8216;It is
I&#8217;, and tells afterwards any other name that belongs to him. And,
because He, as the first of all of them consumed by fire all the sins,
therefore he is called Purusha....</p>

<p>He was afraid; therefore man, when alone, is afraid. He then
looked round. Since nothing but myself exists, of whom should I
be afraid? Hence his fear departed; for whom should he fear, since
fear arises from another.</p>

<p>He did not feel delight. Therefore nobody, when alone, feels
delight. He was desirous of a second. He was in the same state
as husband (Pati) and wife (Patni).... He divided this self twofold.
Hence were husband and wife produced. Therefore was
this only a half of himself, as a split pea is of the whole....
This void is thus completed by woman. He approached her.
Hence men were born.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The first two &#8220;mortals&#8221; then assumed the forms of
all creatures, male and female in turn. They were, in
order, the first cattle, the first horses, the first asses, the
first goats, the first sheep, and so on. &#8220;In this manner
He created every living pair whatsoever down to the
ants.&#8221; Then he reflected and said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> &#8220;I am verily this
creation, for I created this all.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lesson then follows. Men say, &#8220;Sacrifice to this,
sacrifice to this, sacrifice to one or the other god?&#8221; But
these words are &#8220;not proper&#8221;, because &#8220;He is really this
creation; for he verily is all the gods&#8221;.</p>

<p>Thus the first Being, as a commentator remarked,
&#8220;whose nature comprehended all elements, who is eternal,
who is not conceived by thought, sprang forth by himself....
He consumed all sins, for unless one is in a worldly
state he cannot consume sins.... Being mortal he
created immortals.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>From the myth of the chaos-giant Purusha we pass to
the higher pantheistic conception of Brahm&#259;, the soul of
the Universe.</p>

<p>Before the Vedic Age had come to a close an unknown
poet, who was one of the world's great thinkers, had
risen above the popular materialistic ideas concerning the
hammer god and the humanized spirits of Nature, towards
the conception of the World Soul and the First Cause&mdash;the
&#8220;Unknown God&#8221;. He sang of the mysterious
beginning of all things:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div>
<p class="poematrib"><i>Rigveda</i>, x, 129 (Griffith's trans.).</p>
</div>

<p>The poet goes on to say that wise men had discovered
in their hearts that the germ of Being existed in Not
Being. But who, he asked, could tell how Being first
originated? The gods came later, and are unable to
reveal how Creation began. He who guards the Universe
knows, or mayhap he does not know.</p>

<p>Other late Rigvedic poets summed up the eternal
question regarding the Great Unknown in the interrogative
pronoun &#8220;What?&#8221; (Ka). Men's minds were confronted
by an inspiring and insoluble problem. In our
own day the Agnostics say, &#8220;I do not know&#8221;; but this
hackneyed phrase does not reflect the spirit of enquiry
like the arresting &#8220;What?&#8221; of the pondering old forest
hermits of ancient India.</p>

<p>The priests who systematized religious beliefs and
practices in the <i>Brahmanas</i> identified &#8220;Ka&#8221; with Praja´pati,
the Creator, and with Brahma, another name of
the Creator.</p>

<p>In the Vedas the word &#8220;brahma&#8221; signifies &#8220;devotion&#8221;
or &#8220;the highest religious knowledge&#8221;. Later Brahm&#259;
(neuter) was applied to the World Soul, the All in All,
the primary substance from which all that exists has
issued forth, the Eternal Being &#8220;of which all are phases&#8221;;
Brahm&#259; was the Universal Self, the Self in the various
Vedic gods, the Self in man, bird, beast, and fish, the
Life of Life, the only reality, the unchangeable. This
one essence or Self (Atman) permeates the whole Universe.
Brahm&#259; is the invisible force in the seed, as he is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
&#8220;vital spark&#8221; in mobile creatures. In the <i>Khandogva
Upanishad</i> a young Brahman receives instruction from his
father. The sage asks if his pupil has ever endeavoured
to find out how he can hear what cannot be heard, how
he can see what cannot be seen, and how he can know
what cannot be known? He then asks for the fruit of
the Nyagrodha tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is one, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Break it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is broken, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you see there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not anything, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My son,&#8221; said the father, &#8220;that subtile essence which
you do not perceive there, of that very essence this great
Nyagrodha tree exists. Believe it, my son. That which
is the subtile essence, in it all that exists has itself.
It is the True. It is the Self; and thou, my son,
art it.&#8221;</p>

<p>In <i>Katha Upanishad</i> a sage declares:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The whole universe trembles within the life (Brahm&#259;); emanating
from it (Brahm&#259;) the universe moves on. It is a great fear,
like an uplifted thunderbolt. Those who know it become immortal....</p>

<p>As one is reflected in a looking-glass, so the soul is in the body;
as in a dream, so in the world of the forefathers; as in water, so in
the world of the Gandharvas; as in a picture and in the sunshine,
so in the world of Brahm&#259;....</p>

<p>The soul's being (nature) is not placed in what is visible; none
beholds it by the eye.... Through thinking it gets manifest
Immortal become those who know it....</p>

<p>The soul is not to be gained by word, not by the mind, not by
the eye, how could it be perceived by any other than him who
declares it exists?</p>

<p>When all the desires cease that are cherished in his heart
(intellect) then the mortal becomes immortal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>When all the bonds of the heart are broken in this life, then
the mortal becomes immortal....<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The salvation of the soul is secured by union with
Brahm&#259;, the supreme and eternal Atman (Self), &#8220;the
power which receives back to itself again all worlds....
The identity of the Brahm&#259; and the Atman, of God
and the Soul, is the fundamental thought of the entire
doctrine of the Upanishads.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>Various creation myths were framed by teachers to
satisfy the desire for knowledge regarding the beginning
of things. The divine incarnation of Brahm&#259; is known
as Brahma (masculine) Prajapati, and Nãrãyana.</p>

<p>In one account we read: &#8220;At first the Universe was
not anything. There was neither sky, nor earth, nor air.
Being non-existent it resolved, &#8216;Let me be&#8217;. It became
fervent. From that fervour smoke was produced. It
again became fervent. From that fervour fire was produced.&#8221;
Afterwards the fire became &#8220;rays&#8221; and the
rays condensed like a cloud, producing the sea. A
magical formula (Dásahotri) was next created. &#8220;Prajapati
is the Dásahotri.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eminently Brahmanic in character is the comment
inserted here: &#8220;That man succeeds who, thus knowing
the power of austere abstraction (or fervour), practises it.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Prajapati arose from the primordial waters he
&#8220;wept, exclaiming, &#8216;For what purpose have I been born if
(I have been born) from this which forms no support?...&#8217;
That (the tears) which fell into the water became
the earth. That which he wiped away became the air.
That which he wiped away, upwards, became the sky.
From the circumstance that he wept (<i>arodít</i>), these two
regions have the name of <i>rodasí</i> (worlds)....&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>Prajapati afterwards created Asuras and cast off his
body, which became darkness; he created men and cast
off his body, which became moonlight; he created seasons
and cast off his body, which became twilight; he created
gods and cast off his body, which became day. The
Asuras received milk in an earthen dish, men in a wooden
dish, the seasons in a silver dish, and the gods were given
Soma in a golden dish. In the end Prajapati created
Death, &#8220;a devourer of creatures&#8221;.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mind (or soul, <i>manas</i>) was created from the non-existent&#8221;,
adds a priestly commentator. &#8220;Mind created
Prajapati. Prajapati created offspring. All this, whatever
exists, rests absolutely on mind.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>In another mythical account of Creation, Prajapati
emerges, like the Egyptian Horus, from a lotus bloom
floating on the primordial waters.</p>

<p>The most elaborate story of Creation is found in the
<i>Laws of Manu</i>, the eponymous ancestor of mankind and
the first lawgiver.</p>

<p>It relates that in the beginning the Self-Existent
Being desired to create living creatures. He first created
the waters, which he called &#8220;narah&#8221;, and then a seed; he
flung the seed into the waters, and it became a golden
egg which had the splendour of the sun. From the egg
came forth Brahma, Father of All. Because Brahma
came from the &#8220;waters&#8221;, and they were his first home or
path (ayana), he is called Narayana.</p>

<p>The Egyptian sun god Ra similarly rose from the
primordial waters as the sun-egg. Ptah came from the
egg which, according to one myth, was laid by the chaos
goose, and to another issued from the mouth of Khnumu.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
This conception may have had origin in the story of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>giant of the folk tales who concealed his soul in the egg,
in the tree, and in various animal forms. There are
references in Indian literature to Brahma's tree, and
Brahma is identified with Purusha, who became in
turn a cow, a goat, a horse, &amp;c., to produce living
creatures.</p>

<p>In Manu's account of Creation we meet for the first
time with the Maha-rishis or Deva-rishis, the Celestial
priest poets. These are the mind-born sons of Brahma,
who came into existence before the gods and the demons.
Indeed, they are credited with some acts of creation. The
seven or fourteen Manus were also created at the beginning.
Originally there was but a single Manu, &#8220;the
father of men&#8221;.</p>

<p>The inclusion of the Rishis and the Manus among
the deities is a late development of orthodox Brahmanism.
They appear to represent the Fathers (Pitris) who were
adored by ancestor worshippers. The tribal patriarch
Bhrigu, for instance, was a Celestial Rishi.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that more than one current
of thought was operating during the course of the centuries,
and over a wide area, in shaping the complex
religion which culminated in modern Hinduism. The
history of Hinduism is the history of a continual struggle
between the devotees of folk religion and the expounders
of the Forest Books produced by the speculative sages
who, in their quest for Truth, used primitive myths to
illustrate profound doctrinal teachings. By the common
people these myths were given literal interpretation.
Among the priests there were also &#8220;schools of thought&#8221;.
One class of Brahmans, it has been alleged, was concerned
chiefly regarding ritual, the mercenary results
of their teachings, and the achievement of political
power: men of this type appear to have been too ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
to effect compromises by making concession to popular
opinion.</p>

<p>Just as the <i>Atharva-veda</i> came into existence as a book
after the <i>Rigveda</i> had been compiled, so did many traditional
beliefs of animistic character receive recognition
by Brahmanic &#8220;schools&#8221; after the period of the early
<i>Upanishads</i>. It may be, however, that we should also
recognize in these &#8220;innovations&#8221; the influence of races
which imported their own modes of thought, or of Aryan
tribes that had been in contact for long periods with other
civilizations known and unknown.</p>

<p>In endeavouring to trace the sources of foreign influences,
we should not always expect to find clues in the
mythologies of great civilizations like Babylonia, Assyria,
or Egypt alone. The example of the Hebrews, a people
who never invented anything, and yet produced the
greatest sacred literature of the world, is highly suggestive
in this connection. It is possible that an intellectual
influence was exercised in early times over great
conquering races by humble forgotten peoples whose
artifacts give no indication of their mental activity.</p>

<p>In Indian Aryan mythology we are suddenly confronted
at a comparatively late period, at any rate some
time after tribal settlements were effected all over Hindustan
from the Bay of Bengal to the Arabian Sea, with
fully developed conceptions regarding the World's Ages
and Transmigration of Souls, which, it is quite evident,
did not originate after the Aryan conquest of Hindustan.
Both doctrines can be traced in Greek and Celtic (Irish)
mythologies, but they are absent from Teutonic mythology.
From what centre and what race they originally
emanated we are unable to discover. The problem
presented is a familiar one. At the beginnings of all
ancient religious systems and great civilizations we catch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
glimpses of unknown and vanishing peoples who had
sowed the seeds for the harvests which their conquerors
reaped in season.</p>

<p>The World's Ages are the &#8220;Yugas&#8221; of Brahmanism.
&#8220;Of this elaborate system ... no traces are found in
the hymns of the <i>Rigveda</i>. Their authors were, indeed,
familiar with the word &#8216;yuga&#8217;, which frequently occurs
in the sense of age, generation, or tribe.... The first
passage of the <i>Rigveda</i> in which there is any indication
of a considerable mundane period being noted is where
&#8216;a first&#8217; or an earlier age (yuga) of the gods is mentioned
when &#8216;the existent sprang from the non-existent&#8217;.... In
one verse of the <i>Atharva-veda</i>, however, the word
&#8216;yuga&#8217; is so employed as to lead to the supposition that
a period of very long duration is intended. It is there
said: &#8216;We allot to thee a hundred, ten thousand years,
two, three, four ages (yugas)&#8217;.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>Professor Muir traced references in the <i>Brahmanas</i> to
the belief in &#8220;Yugas&#8221; as &#8220;Ages&#8221;, but showed that these
were isolated ideas with which, however, the authors of
these books were becoming familiar.</p>

<p>When the system of Yugas was developed by the Indian
priestly mathematicians, the result was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>One year of mortals is equal to one day of the gods. 12,000
divine years are equal to a period of four Yugas, which is thus
made up, viz.:</p>

<div class="center">

</table></div>

</blockquote>

<p>These 12,000 divine years equal 4,320,000 years of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
mortals, each human year being composed of 360 days.
A thousand of these periods of 4,320,000 years equals
one day (Kalpa) of Brahma. During &#8220;the day of
Brahma&#8221; fourteen Manus reign: each Manu period is a
Manvantara. A year of Brahma is composed of 360
Kalpas, and he endures for 100 of these years. One
half of Brahma's existence has now expired.</p>

<p>At the end of each &#8220;day&#8221; (Kalpa) Brahma sleeps for
a night of equal length, and before falling asleep the
Universe becomes water as at the beginning. He creates
anew when he wakes on the morning of the next Kalpa.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>One of the most interesting accounts of the Yugas is
given in the <i>Mahábhárata</i>. It is embedded in a narrative
which reflects a phase of the character of that great epic.</p>

<p>Bhima of the Pan´davas, the human son of the wind
god Vayu, once went forth to obtain for his beloved
queen the flowers of Paradise&mdash;those Celestial lotuses of
a thousand petals with sun-like splendour and unearthly
fragrance, which prolong life and renew beauty: they grow
in the demon-guarded woodland lake in the region of
Kuvera, god of treasure. Bhima hastened towards the
north-east, facing the wind, armed with a golden bow and
snake-like arrows; like an angry lion he went, nor ever
felt weary. Having climbed a great mountain he entered
a forest which is the haunt of demons, and he saw stately
and beautiful trees, blossoming creepers, flowers of various
hues, and birds with gorgeous plumage. A soft wind
blew in his face; it was anointed with the perfume of
Celestial lotus; it was as refreshing as the touch of a
father's hand. Beautiful was that sacred retreat. The
great clouds spread out like wings and the mountain
seemed to dance; shining streams adorned it like to a
necklace of pearls.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>
<p>Bhima went speedily through the forest; stags, with
grass in their mouths, looked up at him unafraid; invisible
Yakshas and Gandharvas watched him as he went
on swifter than the wind, and ever wondering how he
could obtain the flowers of Paradise without delay....</p>

<p>At length he hastened like to a hurricane, making the
earth tremble under his feet, and lions and tigers and elephants
and bears arose and took flight from before him.
Terrible was then the roaring of Bhima. Birds fluttered
terror-stricken and flew away; in confusion arose the
geese and the ducks and the herons and the kokilas....<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
Bhima tore down branches; he struck trees and overthrew
them; he smote and slew elephants and lions and tigers
that crossed his path. He blew on his war-shell and the
heavens trembled; the forest was stricken with fear;
mountain caves echoed the clamour; elephants trumpeted
in terror and lions howled dismally.</p>

<p>The ape god Hanuman<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> was awakened; drowsily he
yawned and he lashed his long tail with tempest fury
until it stretched forth like a mighty pole and obstructed
the path of Bhima. Thus the ape god, who was also
a son of Vayu, the wind, made Bhima to pause. Opening
his red sleepy eyes, he said: &#8220;Sick am I, but I was slumbering
sweetly; why hast thou awakened me so rudely?
Whither art thou going? Yonder mountains are closed
against thee: thou art treading the path of the gods.
Therefore pause and repose here: do not hasten to
destruction.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Bhima: &#8220;Who art thou? I am a Kshatriya, the
son of Vayu.... Arise and let me pass, or else thou
wilt perish.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hanuman said: &#8220;I am sickly and cannot move; leap
over me.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>Said Bhima: &#8220;I cannot leap over thee. It is forbidden
by the Supreme Soul, else would I bound as
Hanuman bounded over the ocean, for I am his brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hanuman said: &#8220;Then move my tail and go past.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Bhima endeavoured to lift the tail of the ape
god, but failed, and he said: &#8220;Who art thou that hath
assumed the form of an ape; art thou a god, or a spirit,
or a demon?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hanuman said: &#8220;I am the son of Vayu, even
Hanuman. Thou art my elder brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Bhima: &#8220;I would fain behold the incomparable
form thou didst assume to leap over the ocean.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hanuman said: &#8220;At that Age the universe was not
as it is now. Thou canst not behold the form I erstwhile
had.... In Krita Yuga there was one state of things
and in the Treta Yuga another; greater change came
with Dwãpara Yuga, and in the present Yuga there is
lessening, and I am not what I have been. The gods,
the saints, and all things that are have changed. I have
conformed with the tendency of the present age and the
influence of Time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Bhima: &#8220;I would fain learn of thee regarding
the various Yugas. Speak and tell what thou dost know,
O Hanuman.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ape god then spake and said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> &#8220;The Krita Yuga
(Perfect Age) was so named because there was but one
religion, and all men were saintly: therefore they were
not required to perform religious ceremonies. Holiness
never grew less, and the people did not decrease. There
were no gods in the Krita Yuga, and there were no
demons or Yakshas, and no Rakshasas or Nagas. Men
neither bought nor sold; there were no poor and no
rich; there was no need to labour, because all that men
required was obtained by the power of will; the chief
virtue was the abandonment of all worldly desires. The
Krita Yuga was without disease; there was no lessening
with the years; there was no hatred, or vanity, or evil
thought whatsoever; no sorrow, no fear. All mankind
could attain to supreme blessedness. The universal soul
was Narayana: he was <i>White</i>; he was the refuge of all
and was sought for by all; the identification of self with
the universal soul was the whole religion of the Perfect
Age.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the Treta Yuga sacrifices began, and the World
Soul became <i>Red</i>; virtue lessened a quarter. Mankind
sought truth and performed religious ceremonies; they
obtained what they desired by giving and by doing.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the Dwãpara Yuga the aspect of the World Soul
was <i>Yellow</i>: religion lessened one-half. The Veda, which
was one (the <i>Rigveda</i>) in the Krita Yuga, was divided
into four parts, and although some had knowledge of
the four Vedas, others knew but three or one. Mind
lessened, Truth declined, and there came desire and diseases
and calamities; because of these men had to undergo
penances. It was a decadent Age by reason of the prevalence
of sin.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the Kali Yuga<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> the World Soul is <i>Black</i> in hue:
it is the Iron Age; only one quarter of virtue remaineth.
The world is afflicted, men turn to wickedness; disease
cometh; all creatures degenerate; contrary effects are obtained
by performing holy rites; change passeth over all
things, and even those who live through many Yugas must
change also.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having spoken thus, Hanuman bade Bhima to turn
back, but Bhima said: &#8220;I cannot leave thee until I have
gazed upon thy former shape.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Hanuman favoured his brother, and assumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
his vast body; he grew till he was high as the Vindhya
mountain: he was like to a great golden peak with splendour
equal to the sun, and he said: &#8220;I can assume even
greater height and bulk by reason of mine own power.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having spoken thus, Hanuman permitted Bhima to
proceed on his way under the protection of Vayu, god of
wind. He went towards the flowery steeps of the sacred
mountain, and at length he reached the Celestial lotus
lake of Kuvera, which was shaded by trees and surrounded
by lilies; the surface of the waters was covered
with golden lotuses which had stalks of lapis lazuli.
Yakshas, with big eyes, came out against Bhima, but he
slew many, and those that remained were put to flight.
He drank the waters of the lake, which renewed his
strength. Then he gathered the Celestial lotuses for his
queen.</p>

<p>In this tale we discover the ancient Indo-European
myth regarding the earth's primitive races. The first
age is the White Age, the second is the Red Age, the
third the Yellow Age, and the fourth, the present Kali
Yuga, is the Black or Iron Age.</p>

<p>Hesiod, the Greek poet, in his <i>Works and Days</i>,
divided the mythical history of Greece similarly, but the
order of the Ages was different; the first was the Golden
Age (yellow); the second was the Silver Age (white);
the third was the Bronze Age (red); the fourth was the
Age of the Heroes; and the fifth was the Age in which
Hesiod lived&mdash;the Iron (black) Age. The fourth Age
is evidently a late interpolation. Authorities consider
that the Heroic Age did not belong to the original
scheme.</p>

<p>In the Greek Golden Age men lived like the gods
under the rule of Kronos; they never suffered the ills of
old age, nor lost their strength; they feasted continually,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
and enjoyed peace and security. The whole world prospered.
When this race passed away they became beneficent
spirits who watched over mankind and distributed
riches.</p>

<p>In the Silver Age mankind were inferior; children
were reared up for a century, and died soon afterwards;
sacrifice and worship was neglected. In the end Zeus,
son of Kronos, destroyed the Silver Race.</p>

<p>In the Bronze Age mankind sprang from the ash.
They were endowed with great strength, and worked in
bronze and had bronze houses: iron was unknown. But
Bronze Age men were takers of life, and at length Black
Death removed them all to Hades.</p>

<p>Zeus created the fourth race, which was represented
by the semi-divine heroes of a former generation; when
they fell in battle on the plain of Troy and elsewhere,
Zeus consigned them to the Islands of the Blest, where
they were ruled over by Kronos. The fifth Age may
originally have been the fourth. As much is suggested
by another Hesiodic legend which sets forth that all
mankind are descended from two survivors of the Flood
at the close of the Bronze Age.</p>

<p>In <i>Le Cycle Mythologique Irlandais et la Mythologie
Celtique</i>, the late Professor D'Arbois de Jubainville has
shown that these Ages are also a feature of Celtic (Irish)
mythology. Their order, however, differs from those in
Greek, but it is of special interest to note that they are
arranged in exactly the same colour order as those given
in the <i>Mahábhárata</i>. The first Celtic Age is that of Partholon,
which de Jubainville identified with the Silver
Age (white); the second is Nemed's, the Bronze Age
(red); the third is the Tuatha de Danann, the Golden
Age (yellow); and the fourth is the Age of the dark
Milesians, called after their divine ancestor Mile, son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
Beli, the god of night and death. The Irish claim descent
from the Milesians.</p>

<p>Professor D'Arbois de Jubainville considered that the
differences between the Irish and Greek versions of the
ancient doctrine were due in part to the developments
which Irish legend received after the introduction of
Christianity. There are, however, he showed, striking
affinities. The Tuatha de Danann, for instance, like the
&#8220;Golden Race&#8221; of the Greeks, became invisible, and
shared the dominion of the world with men, &#8220;sometimes
coming to help them, sometimes disputing with them the
pleasures of life&#8221;.</p>

<p>Like the early Christian annalists of Ireland, the
Indian Brahmans appear to have utilized the legends
which were afloat among the people. Both in the Greek
and Celtic (Irish) myths the people of the Silver Age
are distinguished for their folly; in the Indian Silver or
White Age the people were so perfect and holy that it
was not necessary for them to perform religious ceremonies;
they simply uttered the mystic word &#8220;Om&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>There are many interesting points of resemblance
between certain of the Irish and Indian legends. We
are informed, for instance, of the Celtic St. Finnen, who
fasted like a Brahman, so to compel a pagan sage, Tuan
MacCarell, to reveal the ancient history of Ireland. Tuan
had lived all through the various mythical Ages; his
father was the brother of Partholon, king of the &#8220;Silver
Race&#8221;. At the end of the First Age, Tuan was a &#8220;long-haired,
grey, naked, and miserable old man&#8221;. One evening
he fell asleep, and when he woke up he rejoiced to
find that he had become a young stag. He saw the
people of Nemed (the Bronze or Red Race) arriving in
Ireland; he saw them passing away. Then he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
transformed into a black boar; afterwards he was a vulture,
and in the end he became a fish. When he had existed
as a fish for twenty years he was caught by a fisherman.
The queen had Tuan for herself, and ate his fish form,
with the result that she gave birth to the sage as her son.</p>

<p>In similar manner Bata of the Egyptian Anpu-Bata
story,<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> after existing as a blossom, a bull, and a tree,
became the son of his unfaithful wife, who swallowed
a chip of wood.</p>

<p>Tuan MacCarell assured St. Finnen, &#8220;in the presence
of witnesses&#8221;, as we are naively informed, that he remembered
all that happened in Ireland during the period
of 1500 years covered by his various incarnations.</p>

<p>Another, and apparently a later version of the legend,
credits the Irish sage, the fair Fintan, son of Bochra, with
having lived for 5550 years before the Deluge, and 5500
years after it. He fled to Ireland with the followers of
Cesara, granddaughter of Noah, to escape the flood.
Fintan, however, was the only survivor, and, according
to Irish chronology, he did not die until the sixth century
of the present era.</p>

<p>One of the long-lived Indian sages was named Markandeya.
In the <i>Vana Parva</i> section of the <i>Mahábhárata</i>
he visits the exiled Pandava brethren in a forest, and
is addressed as &#8220;the great Muni, who has seen many
thousands of ages passing away. In this world&#8221;, says
the chief exile,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> &#8220;there is no man who hath lived so long
as thou hast.... Thou didst adore the Supreme Deity
when the Universe was dissolved, and the world was
without a firmament, and there were no gods and no
demons. Thou didst behold the re-creation of the four
orders of beings when the winds were restored to their
places and the waters were consigned to their proper
place.... Neither death nor old age which causeth the
body to decay have any power over thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Markandeya, who has full knowledge of the Past,
the Present, and the Future, informs the exiles that the
Supreme Being is &#8220;great, incomprehensible, wonderful,
and immaculate, without beginning and without end....
He is the Creator of all, but is himself Increate, and is
the cause of all power.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>After the Universe is dissolved, all Creation is renewed,
and the cycle of the four Ages begins again with
Krita Yuga. &#8220;A cycle of the Yugas comprises twelve
thousand divine years. A full thousand of such cycles
constitutes a Day of Brahma.&#8221; At the end of each Day
of Brahma comes &#8220;Universal Destruction&#8221;.</p>

<p>Markandeya goes on to say that the world grows
extremely sinful at the close of the last Kali Yuga of the
Day of Brahma. Brahmans abstain from prayer and
meditation, and Sudras take their place. Kshatriyas and
Vaisyas forget the duties of their castes; all men degenerate
and beasts of prey increase. The earth is ravaged
by fire, cows give little milk, fruit trees no longer blossom,
Indra sends no rain; the world of men becomes filled
with sin and immorality.... Then the earth is swept
by fire, and heavy rains fall until the forests and mountains
are covered over by the rising flood. All the winds
pass away; they are absorbed by the Lotus floating on
the breast of the waters, in which the Creator sleeps; the
whole Universe is a dark expanse of water.</p>

<p>Although even the gods and demons have been destroyed
at the eventide of the last Yuga, Markandeya survives.
He wanders over the face of the desolate waters
and becomes weary, but is unable to find a resting-place.
At length he perceives a banyan tree; on one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
its boughs is a Celestial bed, and sitting on the bed is a
beautiful boy whose face is as fair as a full-blown lotus.
The boy speaks and says; &#8220;O Markandeya, I know that
thou art weary.... Enter my body and secure repose.
I am well pleased with thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Markandeya enters the boy's mouth and is swallowed.
In the stomach of the Divine One the sage beholds the
whole earth (that is, India) with its cities and kingdoms,
its rivers and forests, and its mountains and plains; he
sees also the gods and demons, mankind and the beasts of
prey, birds and fishes and insects....</p>

<p>The sage related that he shook with fear when he
beheld these wonders, and desired the protection of the
Supreme Being, whereat he was ejected from the boy's
mouth, and found himself once again on the branch of
the banyan tree in the midst of the wide expanse of dark
waters.</p>

<p>Markandeya was then informed by the Lord of All
regarding the mysteries which he had beheld. The Divine
One spoke saying: &#8220;I have called the waters &#8216;Nara&#8217;, and
because they were my &#8216;Ayana&#8217;, or home, I am Narayana,
the source of all things, the Eternal, the Unchangeable.
I am the Creator of all things, and the Destroyer of all
things.... I am all the gods.... Fire is my mouth,
the earth is my feet, and the sun and the moon are my
eyes; the Heaven is the crown of my head, and the
cardinal points are my ears; the waters are born of my
sweat. Space with the cardinal points are my body, and
the Air is in my mind.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>The Creator continues, addressing Markandeya:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> &#8220;I
am the wind, I am the Sun, I am Fire. The stars are
the pores of my skin, the ocean is my robe, my bed and
my dwelling-place....&#8221; The Divine One is the source
of good and evil: &#8220;Lust, wrath, joy, fear, and the overclouding
of the intellect, are all different forms of me.... Men
wander within my body, their senses are overwhelmed
by me.... They move not according to their
own will, but as they are moved by me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Markandeya then related that the Divine Being said:
&#8220;I create myself into new forms. I take my birth in the
families of virtuous men.... I create gods and men,
and Gandharvas and Rakshas and all immobile beings,
and then destroy them all myself (when the time cometh).
For the preservation of rectitude and morality, I assume
a human form; and when the season for action cometh,
I again assume forms that are inconceivable. In the
Krita Age I become white, in the Treta Age I become
yellow, in the Dwãpara I become red, and in the Kali
Age I become dark in hue.... And when the end
cometh, assuming the fierce form of Death, alone I destroy
all the three worlds with their mobile and immobile
existences.... Alone do I set agoing the wheel of
Time: I am formless: I am the Destroyer of all creatures:
and I am the cause of all efforts of all my creatures.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>Markandeya afterwards witnessed &#8220;the varied and
wondrous creation starting into life&#8221;.</p>

<p>The theory of Metempsychosis, or Transmigration of
Souls, is generally regarded as being of post-Vedic growth
in India as an orthodox doctrine. Still, it remains an open
question whether it was not professed from the earliest
times by a section of the various peoples who entered
the Punjab at different periods and in various stages of
culture. We have already seen that the burial customs
differed. Some consigned the dead hero to the &#8220;House
of Clay&#8221;, invoking the earth to shroud him as a mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
who covers her son with her robe, and the belief ultimately
prevailed that Yama, the first man, had discovered the
path leading to Paradise, which became known as the
&#8220;Land of the Fathers&#8221; (Pitris). The fire worshippers,
who identified Agni with the &#8220;vital spark&#8221;, cremated the
dead, believing that the soul passed to heaven like the
burnt offering, which was the food of the gods. It is
apparent, therefore, that in early times sharp differences
of opinion existed among the tribes regarding the destiny
of the soul. Other unsung beliefs may have obtained
ere the Brahmans grew powerful and systematized an
orthodox creed. The doctrine of Metempsychosis may
have had its ancient adherents, although these were not
at first very numerous. In one passage of the <i>Rigveda</i>
&#8220;the soul is spoken of as departing to the waters or the
plants&#8221;, and it &#8220;may&#8221;, says Professor Macdonell, &#8220;contain
the germs of the theory&#8221; of Transmigration of Souls.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>The doctrine of Metempsychosis was believed in by
the Greeks and the Celts. According to Herodotus the
former borrowed it from Egypt, and although some have
cast doubt on the existence of the theory in Egypt, there
are evidences that it obtained there as in early Aryanized
India among sections of the people.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> It is possible that
the doctrine is traceable to a remote racial influence regarding
which no direct evidence survives.</p>

<p>All that we know definitely regarding the definite
acceptance of the theory in India is that in <i>Satapatha
Brahmana</i> it is pointedly referred to as a necessary element
of orthodox religion. The teacher declares that those who
perform sacrificial rites are born again and attain to immortality,
while those who neglect to sacrifice pass through
successive existences until Death ultimately claims them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>According to Upanishadic belief the successive rebirths in
the world are forms of punishment for sins committed, or
a course of preparation for the highest state of existence.</p>

<p>In the code of Manu it is laid down, for instance, that
he who steals gold becomes a rat, he who steals uncooked
food a hedgehog, he who steals honey a stinging insect;
a murderer may become a tiger, or have to pass through
successive states of existence as a camel, a dog, a pig, a
goat, &amp;c.; other wrongdoers may have to exist as grass,
trees, worms, snails, &amp;c. As soon as a man died, it was
believed that he was reborn as a child, or a reptile, as the
case might be. Sufferings endured by the living were
believed to be retribution for sins committed in a former
life.</p>

<p>Another form of this belief had evidently some connection
with lunar worship, or, at any rate, with the recognition
of the influence exercised by the moon over life in
all its phases; it is declared in the <i>Upanishads</i> that &#8220;all
who leave this world go directly to the moon. By their
lives its waxing crescent is increased, and by means of its
waning it brings them to a second birth. But the moon
is also the gate of the heavenly world, and he who can
answer the questions of the moon is allowed to pass beyond
it. He who can give no answer is turned to rain
by the moon and rained down upon the earth. He is
born again here below, as worm or fly, or fish or bird, or
lion, or boar or animal with teeth, or tiger, or man, or
anything else in one or another place, according to his
works and his knowledge.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>Belief in Metempsychosis ultimately prevailed all over
India, and it is fully accepted by Hinduism in our own
day. Brahmans now teach that the destiny of the soul
depends on the mental attitude of the dying person: if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
his thoughts are centred on Brahma he enters the state of
everlasting bliss, being absorbed in the World Soul; if,
however, he should happen to think of a favourite animal
or a human friend, the soul will be reborn as a cow, a
horse, or a dog, or it may enter the body of a newly-born
child and be destined to endure once again the ills that
flesh is heir to.</p>

<p>In Egypt, according to Herodotus, the adherents of
the Transmigration theory believed that the soul passed
through many states of existence, until after a period of
about three thousand years it once again reanimated the
mummy. The Greeks similarly taught that &#8220;the soul
continues its journey, alternating between a separate, unrestrained
existence and fresh reincarnation, round the
wide circle of necessity, as the companion of many bodies
of men and animals&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> According to Cæsar, the Gauls
professed the doctrine of Metempsychosis quite freely.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>Both in India and in Egypt the ancient doctrine of
Metempsychosis was coloured by the theologies of the
various cults which had accepted it. It has survived,
however, in primitive form in the folk tales. Apparently
the early exponents of the doctrine took no account of
beginning or end; they simply recognized &#8220;the wide
circle of necessity&#8221; round which the soul wandered, just
as the worshippers of primitive nature gods and goddesses
recognized the eternity of matter by symbolizing earth,
air, and heaven as deities long ere they had conceived of
a single act of creation.</p>

<p>Modern-day Brahman pundits, the cultured apostles of
the ancient forest sages, acknowledge a Trinity composed
of Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver, and Shiva
the Destroyer. A rock carving at Elephanta, which
depicts the supreme god with three heads, indicates that
the conception is of considerable antiquity. To what
particular period it must be assigned, however, we cannot
yet definitely decide.</p>

<p>The religious history of India is divided into four
Ages: (1) the Vedic Age; (2) the Brahmanical Age; (3)
the Buddhist Age; and (4) the Age of the reform and
revival of Brahmanism.</p>

<p>As we have seen, many gods were worshipped in the
Vedic Age, but ere it had ended Pantheistic ideas found
expression in the hymns. Two distinct currents of thought
characterize the Brahmanical Age. On the one hand
there was the growth of priestly influence which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
the feature of the <i>Brahmanas</i>, and on the other the
development of the bold Pantheism of the <i>Upanishads</i>,
which are permeated with a catholicity of spirit directly
opposed to narrow and pedantic ritualism. Towards the
close of this Age, Vishnu and Shiva were deities of growing
ascendancy.</p>

<p>The Buddhist Age began in the sixth century before
Christ, and Buddhism gradually supplanted Brahmanism
as a national religion. In the tenth century of our
era, however, Brahmanism was revived, drawing its inspiration
mainly from the <i>Upanishads</i>, and purified by the
teachings of Buddha and other reformers.</p>

<p>These religious movements of the post-Vedic times,
which have exercised a cumulative influence in shaping
modern-day Hinduism, were due directly and indirectly
to the speculative reasonings of the unknown authors of
the <i>Upanishads</i>. The Pantheistic doctrines of these ancient
philosophers, however, hardly constituted a religion: they
were rather an esoteric system of belief devoid of popular
appeal. But they have been the inspiration of a succession
of profound thinkers and eloquent teachers of revered
memory in India, who infused ancient modes of thought
with high philosophic doctrines, and utilized archaic myths
to develop a religion which in its purest form permeates
the acts of everyday life and requires the whole-hearted
devotion and service of pious Hindus to the will of the
Supreme Being.</p>

<p>In the Brahmanical Age Upanishadic teachings made
limited appeal, but evidences are not awanting that knowledge
of them was not confined to the Brahmans, because
the revolts which gave India Buddhism and Jainism originated
among the Kshatriyas. Meanwhile the gods of the
<i>Vedas</i> continued their hold upon the allegiance of the
great masses of the people, although the ancient Vedic
religion had been divested of its simplicity and directness
by the ritualistic priesthood. Gods and men depended
upon the Brahmans for their prosperity and even for their
continued existence. It was taught that &#8220;the gods lived
in fear of death, the strong Ender&#8221;, but were supported
and fed by penance and sacrifice. The priests achieved
spiritual dominion over their rivals, the Kshatriyas.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>There was, however, more than one &#8220;school of
thought&#8221; among the Brahmans. The sages who memorized
and repeated the older Upanishads, and composed
new ones, could not have failed to pass unrecorded judgments
on the superstitious practices of their ritualistic
brethren. Account must also be taken of the example
and teachings of the bands of wandering devotees, the
Bhiksus, who neither performed penances nor offered up
sacrifices, and of the influence exercised by the independent
thinkers among the Kshatriyas, who regarded with
disfavour the pretensions of the powerful priesthood.
The elements of revolt could never have been absent
during the two centuries of the Brahmanical Age. Upanishadic
teachings had stirred the minds of thinking men,
but they had one marked defect; they left unsatisfied the
religious sense which could find no repose in a jungle
of abstract thought. It was impossible, however, for the
leaders of thought to return to the polytheism of the
Vedic Age, or to worship deities controlled by human
beings. A new and higher religion became a necessity
for those who, like the Hebrew Psalmist, appear to have
cried:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;O Lord ... thou desirest not sacrifice, else would I give it;
thou delightest not in burnt offering. The sacrifices of God are a
broken spirit.&#8221;</p>

<p class="right">&mdash;<i>Psalms</i>, li, 16, 17.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At any rate, we find that, before the Brahmanical Age<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
had ended, the conception was becoming more prevalent
of a supreme personal god, greater than Indra or Agni,
and worthy of minds influenced by the <i>Upanishads</i>&mdash;a
god who was the embodiment of the First Cause, an
Infinite Being uncontrolled by the priesthood. One
section of the people appears to have worshipped Vishnu
as the Celestial incarnation of the World Soul, while
another gave recognition to Shiva. In the absence of
records, however, it is impossible to ascertain to what
extent monotheistic ideas were developed by unorthodox
teachers. The new doctrines may have degenerated, like
Buddhism, as they became widespread. It is evident,
however, that the priesthood were unable to ignore them,
for they are referred to in their &#8220;books&#8221;.</p>

<p>Although the political prominence of Vishnu and
Shiva belong to the Age of reformed Brahmanism, it is
undoubted that both deities were worshipped throughout
the long period of Buddhistic ascendancy. The Greek
ambassador Megasthenes, who resided in India between
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 311 and 302, and wrote <i>Ta Indika</i>, furnishes interesting
evidence in this connection. &#8220;By his description of
the god Dionysus, whom they worshipped in the mountains,
Shiva&#8221;, says Professor Macdonell, &#8220;must be intended,
and by Herakles, adored in the plains ... no
other can be meant than Vishnu and his incarnation
Krishna.... These statements seem to justify the conclusion
that Shiva and Vishnu were already prominent
as highest gods, the former in the mountains, the latter
in the Ganges valley.... We also learn from Megasthenes
that the doctrine of the four Ages of the World
(Yugas) was fully developed in India by this time.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>In the <i>Rigveda</i> Vishnu is a god of grace. He is,
however, a secondary deity&mdash;an attribute of the sun and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
a phase of Agni. From the earliest times, it is significant
to note, his benevolent character is emphasized. In one
of the hymns<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> he is called &#8220;the Kinsman&#8221;; he welcomed
to his heaven of bliss the faithful worshippers of the gods.
An interesting reference is made to his &#8220;highest step&#8221;.
As detailed in later writings, the myth involved is to
the effect that the demon Bali, one of the dreaded
Danavas (Titans), had, in the Treta Yuga, secured
temporary ascendancy over the gods. Vishnu appeared
before him in the form of the dwarf Vamana, and requested
as much territory as he could measure out by
taking three strides. The demon granted this request,
and Vishnu immediately assumed the form of a giant;
his first step covered the heavens, the second crossed the
entire earth, and the third and highest reached the abode
of the gods. So was the Universe won back from the
Asuras. It is believed that the myth refers to the progress
of the conquering sun by day and by night.</p>

<p>In <i>Yajurveda</i> Vishnu is more prominent than in the
<i>Rigveda</i>, and in the <i>Brahmanas</i> &#8220;there is a growing tendency&#8221;,
remarks Professor Barnett, &#8220;to regard him as
a blessed Cosmic Spirit&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> He is fully identified with
Brahma in the <i>Mahábhárata</i>. In some of the myths he
is the source of Indra's strength and valour, and he
appears to have absorbed the sublime character of Varuna,
the god of sinners; he is similarly associated with the
sea, but the Sea of Milk.</p>

<p>Shiva is a development of the Vedic storm god
Rudra, who was not only dreaded, but also revered as
a destroyer of evil-doers, hatred, evil, and disease, and
as a nourisher who gave long life.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>Both deities inspired love and reverential fear; they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>won the affections of human hearts and were worshipped
emotionally. Their cults have had independent doctrinal
development, however, and they divide Hinduism to-day
into two great churches, one of which recognizes Vishnu,
and the other Shiva, as the greatest god. Their union
in the Trinity has not yet obliterated sectarian differences.</p>

<p>Many myths have collected round Vishnu, originally
a purely abstract deity, because the faith which he represents
had to be imparted to the masses in &#8220;parables&#8221;.
These &#8220;parables&#8221; were, of course, given literal interpretation
by the people. The majority of the myths
belong to the post-Buddhist Age&mdash;the Age of Brahmanical
revival, during which came into existence the
sacred poems called the <i>Puranas</i>. Many were also incorporated
in the great epics, the <i>Mahábhárata</i> and the
<i>Ramáyana</i>, which existed in part, at least, before the rise
of Buddhism and Jainism.</p>

<p>When Vishnu, the god of mercy and goodness,
received recognition as Narayana in the Brahmanical
Age, he was worshipped as the &#8220;unconquerable preserver&#8221;
who at the dawn of each Yuga (Age) awoke as
the child of the primordial waters. In one myth he
rises from a lotus bloom; in another he is supposed to
sleep, as Brahma, on the coils of the world-serpent
Shesha, which is &#8220;a part of a part of Vishnu&#8221;. This
serpent rests on the tortoise, Kurma, another form of
Vishnu. When the tortoise moves its limbs, Shesha is
roused to yawn; thus are earthquakes caused. A creation
myth which teaches the absolute supremacy of
Vishnu tells that at the beginning Brahma sprang from
a lotus issuing from the navel of the Preserver, while
Shiva came from his forehead.</p>

<p>Vishnu is a dark god with four arms; in one of his
right hands he holds a warshell, and in the other a
flaming discus, which destroys enemies and returns after
it is flung; in one left hand he holds a mace, and in the
other a lotus bloom.</p>

<p>The belief that the Supreme Being from time to time
&#8220;assumes a human form ... for the preservation of
rectitude and morality&#8221; is an outstanding feature of
Vishnuite religion, which teaches that Vishnu was born
among men as Ramachandra, Krishna, Balarama, and
Buddha. These are the Avataras of the Preserver.
Avatara means literally &#8220;a descent&#8221;, but is used in the
sense of an &#8220;Incarnation&#8221;.</p>

<p>Rama Chandra is the hero of the <i>Ramáyana</i> epic,
which is summarized in our closing chapters; he is the
human ideal of devotion, righteousness, and manliness,
the slayer of the demon Ravana, who oppressed and
persecuted mankind.</p>

<p>Krishna and his brother Balarama figure as princes
of Dwaraka in the <i>Mahábhárata</i>. Krishna is represented
as the teacher of the Vishnuite faith, the devotional religion
which displaced the Vedic ceremonies and links
Upanishadic doctrines with modern Hinduism. It recognizes
that all men are sinful, and preaches salvation
by Knowledge which embraces Works. Sinners must
surrender themselves to Krishna, the human incarnation
(Avatara) of Vishnu, the Preserver, the God of Love.</p>

<p>This faith is unfolded in the famous <i>Bhagavad-gita</i><a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
in the <i>Bhishma Parva</i> section of the <i>Mahábhárata</i> epic.
Krishna is acting as the counsellor and charioteer of the
Pandava warrior Arjuna. Ere the first day's battle of
the Great War begins, the human Avatara of Vishnu
reveals himself to his friend as the Divine Being, and
gives instruction as to how men may obtain salvation.</p>

<p>Krishna teaches that the soul is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> &#8220;unborn, unchangeable,
eternal, and ancient&#8221;; it is one with the
Supreme Soul, Vishnu, the First Cause, the Source of
All. The soul &#8220;is not slain when the body is slain&#8221;;
it enters new bodies after each death, or else it secures
emancipation from sin and suffering by being absorbed
in the World Soul.... All souls have to go through
a round of births. &#8220;On attaining to Me, however,&#8221; says
Krishna, &#8220;there is no rebirth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Krishna gives Salvation to those who obtain &#8220;Knowledge
of self or Brahma&#8221;.... He says: &#8220;The one who
hath devoted his Self (Soul) to abstraction, casting an
equal eye everywhere, beholdeth his Self in all creatures,
and all creatures in his Self. Unto him that beholdeth
Me in everything and beholdeth everything in Me, I am
never lost and he also is never lost in Me. He that
worshippeth Me as abiding in all creatures, holding yet
that All is One, is a devotee, and whatever mode of life
he may lead, he liveth in Me....</p>

<p>&#8220;Even if thou art the greatest sinner among all that
are sinful, thou shalt yet cross over all transgressions by
the raft of Knowledge&#8221;.... Knowledge destroys all
sins. It is obtained by devotees who, &#8220;casting off attachment,
perform actions for attaining purity of Self,
with the body, the mind, the understanding, and even
the senses, free from desire&#8221;. To such men &#8220;a sod,
a stone, and gold are alike&#8221;.</p>

<p>Krishna, as Vishnu, is thus revealed:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> &#8220;I am the productive
cause of the entire Universe and also its destroyer.
There is nothing else that is higher than myself.... I
am Om (the Trinity) in all the Vedas, the sound in space,
the manliness in man. I am the fragrant odour in earth,
the splendour in fire, the life in all creatures, and penance
in ascetics.... I am the thing to be known, the means
by which everything is cleansed.... I am the soul
(self) seated in the heart of every being. I am the
beginning, the middle, and the end of all beings.... I
am the letter A (in the Sanskrit alphabet).... I am
Death that seizeth all, and the source of all that is to
be.... He that knoweth me as the Supreme Lord
of the worlds, without birth and beginning ... is free
from all sins.... He who doeth everything for me,
who hath me for his supreme object, who is freed from
attachment, who is without enmity towards all beings,
even he cometh to me.... He through whom the
world is not troubled, and who is not troubled by the
world, who is free from joy, wrath, fear, and anxieties,
even he is dear to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>To Arjuna Krishna says: &#8220;Exceedingly dear art thou
to me. Therefore I will declare what is for thy benefit.
Set thy heart on Me, become my devotee, sacrifice to me,
bow down to me. Then shalt thou come to me....
Forsaking all (religious) duties, come to me as thy sole
refuge. I will deliver thee from all sins. Do not
grieve.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is, however, added: &#8220;This is not to be declared by
thee to one who practiseth no austerities, to one who is
not a devotee, to one who never waiteth on a preceptor,
nor yet to one who calumniateth Me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unbelievers are those who are devoid of knowledge.
Krishna says: &#8220;One who hath no knowledge and no
faith, whose mind is full of doubt, is lost.... Doers of
evil, ignorant men, the worst of their species ... do
not resort to Me.&#8221; ... Such men &#8220;return to the path
of the world that is subject to destruction&#8221;. He denounces
&#8220;persons of demoniac natures&#8221; because they
are devoid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> &#8220;purity, good conduct, and truth....
They say that the Universe is void of truth, of guiding
principle and of ruler.... Depending on this view
these men of lost souls, of little intelligence and fierce
deeds, these enemies of the world, are born for the
destruction of the Universe.&#8221; They &#8220;cherish boundless
hopes, limited by death alone&#8221;, and &#8220;covet to obtain
unfairly hoards of wealth for the gratification of their
desires&#8221;; they say, &#8220;This foe hath been slain by me&mdash;I
will slay others.... I am lord, I am the enjoyer....
I am rich and of noble birth&mdash;who else is there that is
like me?... I will make gifts, I will be merry....
Thus deluded by ignorance, tossed about by numerous
thoughts, enveloped in the meshes of delusion, attached
to the enjoyment of objects of desire, they sink into foul
hell.... Threefold is the way to hell, ruinous to the Self
(Soul), namely, lust, wrath, likewise avarice.... Freed
from these three gates of darkness, a man works out his
own welfare, and then repairs to the highest goal.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>Balarama is an incarnation of the world serpent
Shesha. According to the legend, he and Krishna are
the sons of Vasudeva and Devakí. It was revealed to
Kansa, King of Mat´hurã<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>, who was a worshipper of
Shiva, that a son of Devakí would slay him. His majesty
therefore commanded that Devakí's children should be
slain as soon as they were born. Balarama, who was
fair, was carried safely away. Krishna, the dark son,
performed miracles soon after birth. The king had his
father and mother fettered, and the doors of the houses
were secured with locks. But the chains fell from Vasudeva,
and the doors flew open when he stole out into the
night to conceal the babe. As he crossed the river
Jumna, carrying Krishna on his head in a basket, the
waters rose high and threatened to drown him, but the
child put out a foot and the river immediately fell and
became shallow. In Mathura the two brothers performed
miraculous feats during their youth. Indeed,
the myths connected with them suggest that their prototypes
were voluptuous pastoral gods. Krishna, the flute-player
and dancer, is the shepherd lover of the Gopis or
herdsmaids, his favourite being Radhá. He was opposed
to the worship of Indra, and taught the people to make
offerings to a sacred mountain.</p>

<p>King Kansa had resort to many stratagems to accomplish
the death of Krishna, but his own doom could not
be set aside; ultimately he was slain by the two brothers.
The <i>Harivamsa</i>, an appendix to the <i>Mahábhárata</i>, which
is as long as the Iliad and the Odyssey together, is devoted
to the life and adventures of Krishna, who also
figures in the <i>Puranas</i>.</p>

<p>Vishnu's Buddha Avatara was assumed, according to
orthodox teaching, to bring about the destruction of
demons and wicked men who refused to acknowledge
the inspiration of the Vedas and the existence of deities,
and were opposed to the caste system. This attitude was
assumed by the Brahmans because Buddhism was a serious
lay revolt against Brahmanical doctrines and ceremonial
practices.</p>

<p>Buddha, &#8220;the Enlightened&#8221;, was Prince Siddartha of
the royal family Gautama, which, as elsewhere told, ruled
over a Sakya tribe. At his birth marvellous signs foretold
his greatness. Reared in luxury, he was kept apart
from the common people; but when the time of his
awakening came, he was greatly saddened to behold
human beings suffering from disease, sorrow, and old
age. One night he left his wife and child, and went
away to live the life of a contemplative hermit in the
forest, with purpose to find a solution for the great
problem of human sin and suffering. He came under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
the influence of Upanishadic doctrines, and at the end
of six years he returned and began his mission.</p>

<p>Buddha, the great psychologist, was one of the world's
influential teachers, because his doctrines have been embraced
in varying degrees of purity by about a third of
the human race. Yet they are cold and unsatisfying and
gloomy. The &#8220;Enlightener's&#8221; outlook on life was intensely
timid and pessimistic; he was an &#8220;enemy of
society&#8221; in the sense that he made no attempt to effect
social reforms so as to minimize human suffering, which
touched him with deepest sympathy, but unfortunately
filled him with despair; his solution for all problems
was Death; he was the apostle of benevolent Nihilism
and Idealistic Atheism.</p>

<p>There is no supreme personal god in Buddhism and
no hope of immortality. Gods and demons and human
beings are &#8220;living creatures&#8221;; gods have no power over
the Universe, and need not be worshipped or sacrificed
to, because they are governed by laws, and men have
nothing to fear from them.</p>

<p>Buddha denied the existence of the Self-Soul of the
<i>Upanishads</i>. Self is not God, in the sense that it is a
phase of the World Soul. The &#8220;self-state&#8221; is, according
to the &#8220;Enlightener&#8221;, a combination of five elements&mdash;matter,
feeling, imagination, will, and consciousness;
these are united by Kamma,<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> the influence which causes
life to repeat itself. Buddha had accepted, in a limited
sense, the theory of Transmigration of Souls. He taught,
however, that rebirth was the result of actions and desire.
&#8220;It is the yearning for existence&#8221;, he said, &#8220;which leads
from new birth to new birth, which finds its desire in
different directions, the desire for pleasure, the desire for
existence, the desire for power.&#8221; Death occurs when
the five elements which constitute life are divided; after
death nothing remains but the consequences of actions
and thoughts. Rebirth follows because &#8220;the yearning&#8221;,
the essence of &#8220;works&#8221;, brings the elements together
again. The individual exists happily, or the reverse,
according to his conduct in a former life; sorrow and
disease are results of wrong living and wrong thinking
in previous states of existence.</p>

<p>The aim of the Buddhist is to become the &#8220;master
of his fate&#8221;. Life to him is hateful because, as the
Enlightener taught,&#8220;birth is suffering, death is suffering;
to be joined to one thou dost not love is suffering, to
be divided from thy love is suffering, to fail in thy desire
is suffering; in short, the fivefold bonds that unite us to
earth&mdash;those of the five elements&mdash;are suffering&#8221;. As
there can be no life without suffering in various degrees,
it behoves the believer to secure complete emancipation
from the fate of being reborn. Life is a dismal and
tragic failure. The Buddhist must therefore destroy the
influence which unites the five elements and forms another
life. He must achieve the complete elimination of inclination&mdash;of
the yearning for existence. Buddha's
&#8220;sacred truth&#8221;, which secures the desired end, is eightfold&mdash;&#8220;right
belief, right resolve, right speech, right
action, right life, right desire, right thought, and right
self-absorption&#8221;. The reward of the faithful, who attains
to perfect knowledge, unsullied by works, is eternal
emancipation by Nirvana, undisturbed repose or blissful
extinction<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>, which is the Supreme Good. If there had
been no belief in rebirth, the solution would have been
found in suicide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>Buddha taught that the four Noble Verities are: (1)
pain, (2) desire, the cause of pain, (3) pain is extinguished
by Nirvana, (4) the way which leads to Nirvana. The
obliteration of Desire is the first aim of the Buddhist.
This involves the renunciation of the world and of all
evil passions; the believer must live a perfect life according
to the Buddhist moral code, which is as strict as it is
idealistic in the extreme. &#8220;It does not express friendship,
or the feeling of particular affection which a man has for
one or more of his fellow creatures, but that universal
feeling which inspires us with goodwill towards all men
and constant willingness to help them.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>Belief in the sanctity of life is a prevailing note in
Buddhism. The teacher forbade the sacrifice of animals,
as did Isaiah in Judah.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me?
saith the Lord: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the
fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of
lambs, or of he goats.&#8221;</p>

<p class="right"><i>Isaiah</i>, i, II.</p></blockquote>

<p>Brahmanism was influenced in this regard, for offerings
to Vishnu were confined to cakes, curds, sweetmeats,
flowers, oblations, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Buddha, the enemy of the priesthood, was of the
Kshatriya caste, and his religion appears to have appealed
to aristocrats satiated with a luxurious and idle life, who
felt like the Preacher that &#8220;all is vanity&#8221;; it also found
numerous adherents among the wandering bands of unorthodox
devotees. The perfect Buddhist had to live apart
from the world, and engage for long intervals in introspective
contemplation so as to cultivate by a stern analytic
process that frame of mind which enabled him to obliterate
Desire blankly and coldly. Familiar statues of Buddha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
show the posture which must be assumed; the legs are
crossed and twisted, and the hands arranged to suggest
inaction; the eyes gaze on the bridge of the nose.</p>

<p>Monastic orders came into existence for men and
women, but the status of women was not raised. From
these orders were excluded all officials and the victims
of infectious and incurable diseases. A lower class of
Buddhists engaged in worldly duties. Although Buddha
recognized the caste system, his teaching removed its
worst features, for Kshatriyas and converted Brahmans
could accept food from the Sudras without fear of contamination.
Kings embraced the new religion, which
ultimately assumed a national character.</p>

<p>Missionaries were from the earliest times sent abroad,
and Buddhism spread into Burma, Siam, Anam, Tibet,
Mongolia, China, Java, and Japan. The view is suggested
that its influence can be traced in Egypt. &#8220;From
some source,&#8221; writes Professor Flinders Petrie, &#8220;perhaps
the Buddhist mission of Asoka, the ascetic life of recluses
was established in the Ptolemaic times, and monks of the
Serapeum illustrated an ideal to man which had been as
yet unknown in the West. This system of monasticism
continued until Pachomios, a monk of Serapis in Upper
Egypt, became the first Christian monk in the reign of
Constantine.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>Jainism, like Buddhism, was also a revolt against
Brahmanic orthodoxy, and drew its teachers and disciples
chiefly from the aristocratic class. It was similarly influenced
in its origin by the <i>Upanishads</i>. Jainites believe,
however, in soul and the world soul; they recognize the
Hindu deities, but only as exalted souls in a state of
temporary bliss achieved by their virtues; they also worship
a number of &#8220;conquerors&#8221; or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> &#8220;openers of the way&#8221;,
as Buddhism, in debased form, recognizes Buddha and
his disciples as gods, and allows the worship here of a
tooth and there of a hair of the Enlightener, as well as
sacred mounds connected with his pilgrimages. In the
gloomy creed of the Jainites it is taught that &#8220;emancipation&#8221;
may be hastened by rigid austerities which entail
systematic starvation. Many Jainites have in their holy
places given up their lives in this manner, but the practice
is now obsolete.</p>

<p>In the Age which witnessed the decline of Buddhism
in India, and the rise of reformed Brahmanism, the religious
struggle was productive of the long poems called
the <i>Puranas</i> (old tales) to which we have referred. In
these productions some of the ancient myths about the
gods were preserved and new myths were formulated.
They were meant for popular instruction, and especially
to make converts among the unlettered masses. Their
authors were chiefly of the Vishnu cult, which had perpetuated
the teachings of the unknown sages who at the
close of the Brahmanical Age revolted against impersonal
Pantheism, the ritualistic practices of the priesthood, and
the popular conceptions regarding the Vedic deities who
ensured worldly prosperity, but exercised little influence
on the character of the individual.</p>

<p>Indra and Agni and other popular deities were not,
however, excluded from the Pantheon, but were divested
of their ancient splendour and shown to be subject to the
sway of Brahma, their Lord and Creator, whose attributes
they symbolized in their various spheres of activity.
Vishnuites taught that Vishnu was Brahma, and Shivaites
that Shiva was the supreme deity.</p>

<p>In this way, it would appear, the authors of the
<i>Puranas</i> effected a compromise between immemorial beliefs
and practices and the higher religious conceptions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
towards which the people were being gradually elevated.
A similar policy was adopted by Pope Gregory the Great,
who in the year 601 caused the Archbishop of Canterbury
to be instructed to infuse Pagan ceremonials with
Christian symbolism. It was decreed that heathen temples
should be changed into churches, and days consecrated to
sacrificial ceremonies to be observed as Christian festivals.
The Anglo-Saxons were not to be permitted to &#8220;sacrifice
animals to the Devil&#8221;, but to kill them for human consumption
&#8220;to the praise of God&#8221;, so that &#8220;while they
retained some outward joys they might give more ready
response to inward joys&#8221;. The Pope added: &#8220;It is not
possible to cut off everything at once from obdurate
minds; he who endeavours to climb to the highest place
must rise not by bounds, but by degrees or steps.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>It is necessary for us, therefore, in dealing with Puranic
beliefs, and the movement which culminated in modern-day
Hinduism, to make a distinction between the popular
faith and the beliefs of the most enlightened Brahmans,
and also between the process of mythology-making and
the development of religious ideas.</p>

<p>In early Puranic times, when Brahmanism was revived,
Vishnu's benevolent character was exalted to so
high a degree that, it was taught, even demons might
secure salvation through his grace. Prahlada, son of the
King of the Danavas, worshipped Vishnu. As a consequence,
terrible punishments were inflicted upon him by
his angry father. At length Vishnu appeared in the
Danava palace as the Nrisinha incarnation (half man, half
lion), and slew the presumptuous giant king who had
aspired to control the Universe.</p>

<p>Another incarnation of Vishnu was the boar, Varáha.
A demon named Hiranyaksha had claimed the earth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
when at the beginning of one of the Yugas it was raised
from the primordial deep by the Creator in the form of
a boar. Vishnu slew the demon for the benefit of the
human race. Earlier forms of this myth recognize
Brahma, or Prajapati, as the boar. In <i>Taittiriya Brahmana</i>
it is set forth: &#8220;This Universe was formerly water, fluid;
with that (water) Prajapati practised arduous devotions
(saying), &#8216;How shall this universe be (developed)?&#8217; He
beheld a lotus leaf standing. He thought, &#8216;There is
something on which this rests.&#8217; He as a boar&mdash;having
assumed that form&mdash;plunged beneath towards it. He
found the earth down below. Breaking off (a portion
of) her, he rose to the surface.&#8221;</p>

<p>This treatment of the boar is of special interest. In
Egypt the boar was the demon Set, and the &#8220;black pig&#8221;
is the devil in Wales and Scotland, and also in a &#8220;layer&#8221;
of Irish mythology. Hatred of pork prevailed in Egypt
and its vicinity, and still lingers in parts of Ireland and
Wales, but especially in the Scottish Highlands. The
Gauls, like the Aryans of India, did not regard the boar
as a demon, and they ate pork freely, as did also the
Achæans and the Germanic peoples. Roast pig is provided
in Valhal and in the Irish Danann Paradise, but the
Irish &#8220;devil&#8221;, Balor, who resembles the Asura king of
India, had a herd of black pigs.</p>

<p>The struggle between Kshatriyas and Brahmans is
reflected in Vishnu's incarnation as Parasu-rama (Rama
with the axe). He clears the earth twenty-one times of
the visible Kshatriyas, but on each occasion a few survive
to perpetuate the caste.</p>

<p>Jagannath<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> is also regarded as a form of Vishnu,
although apparently not of Brahmanic origin. He is
represented by three forms, representing the dark Krishna,
the fair Balarama, and their sister, Subhadra. Once a
year the idol is bathed and afterwards taken forth in a
great car, which is dragged by pious worshippers. Some
have considered it a meritorious act to commit suicide by
being crushed under its wheels.</p>

<p>It is believed that Vishnu will yet appear as Kalki,
riding on a white horse and grasping a flaming sword.
He will slay the enemies of evil and re-establish pure
religion. Many pious Vishnuites in our own day look
forward to the coming of their supreme deity with fear
and trembling, but not without inflexible faith.</p>

<p class="blockcontents">The Great Indian Epics&mdash;Utilized by the Brahmans&mdash;The Story of

Aryan Tribes&mdash;Kernel of Mahábhárata Epic.</p>


<p>The history of Brahmanism during the Buddhist Age is
enshrined in the great epics <i>Mahábhárata</i> and <i>Ramáyana</i>,
which had their origin before <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 500, and continued to
grow through the centuries.</p>

<p>The <i>Mahabharata</i>, which deals with the Great War
for ascendancy between two families descended from
King Bharata, has been aptly referred to as &#8220;the Iliad
of India&#8221;. It appears to have evolved from a cycle of
popular hero songs, but after assuming epic form it was
utilized by the Brahmans for purposes of religious propaganda.
The warriors were represented as sons of gods
or allies of demons, and the action of the original narrative
was greatly hampered by inserting long speeches and
discussions regarding Brahmanic conceptions and beliefs.
An excellent example of this process is afforded by the
famous <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>, from which we have quoted in
the previous chapter. The narrative of the first day's
battle is interrupted to allow Krishna to expound the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
doctrines of the Vaishnava faith, with purpose to make
converts to the cult of Vishnu. Almost every incident
in the poem is utilized in a similar manner. In fact the
epic, as we are informed in the opening section, &#8220;furnisheth
the means of arriving at the knowledge of
Brahma&#8221;. The priests, with this aim in view, loaded
the chariots of heroes with religious treatises, and transformed
a tribal struggle for supremacy into a great holy
war. If the <i>Iliad</i> survived to us only in Pope's translation,
and our theologians had scattered through it, say,
metrical renderings of Bunyan's <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>, the
Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England, the <i>Westminster
Confession of Faith</i>, Fox's <i>Book of Martyrs</i>, and a
few representative theological works of rival sects, a fate
similar to that which has befallen the <i>Mahabharata</i> would
now overshadow the great Homeric masterpiece. The
&#8220;Iliad of India&#8221; is a part of what may be called the
Hindu Bible, which embraces the <i>Ramayana</i>, the <i>Vedas</i>,
the <i>Upanishads</i>, the <i>Puranas</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The <i>Ramáyana</i>, which is called &#8220;the Odyssey of
India&#8221;, because it deals with the wanderings and adventures
of the exiled prince Rama, was utilized mainly by
the cult of Vishnu, but both Vishnu and Shiva figure
as great gods in the <i>Mahábhárata</i>, and now one and anon
the other is given first place.</p>

<p>If the documentary material, which is available in
India for dealing with its ancient religious beliefs, were
as scanty as those which survive to us from Ancient
Egypt, comparisons might have been drawn between the
Brahmanic cults and the priestly theorists of Heliopolis,
Memphis, Sais, &amp;c., and it might have been remarked of
the one nation as of the other that its people clung to
archaic beliefs long after new and higher religious conceptions
obtained as tenets of orthodox religion. In India<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
the process of change and development can, however, be
not only traced, but partially accounted for, as we have
shown. Old myths were embraced in the epics and the
<i>Puranas</i> for the purpose of educating the people by effecting
a compromise between folk religion and the profound
doctrines of the ancient forest sages.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father Manu&#8221; of the <i>Vedas</i>, who appears to have
been worshipped as a patriarchal ancestor, was, for
instance, embraced in the <i>Mahábhárata</i> by the cult of
Vishnu. He had been exalted by the ritualists as one
who was greater than the gods, because he had been the
first to inaugurate sacrificial rites, and he was afterwards
associated with Brahma in performing some of the acts of
Creation at the beginning of one of the Yugas (Ages). It
was necessary, therefore, to show that he owed his power
and opportunities to Vishnu.</p>

<p>In the <i>Mahábhárata</i> the sage Markandeya refers to
Manu as the great Rishi, who was equal unto Brahma in
glory. He had practised rigid austerities in a forest for
ten thousand years, standing on one leg with uplifted
hand. One day while he brooded in wet clothes, a fish
rose from a stream and asked for his protection against
the greater fish which desired to swallow it, at the same
time promising to reward him. Manu placed the fish in
an earthen jar and tended it carefully till it increased in
size; then he put it in a tank. The fish continued to
grow until the tank became small for it, and Manu heard
it pleading to be transferred to the Ganges, &#8220;the favourite
spouse of Ocean&#8221;. He carried it to the river, and in
time the fish spoke to him, saying: &#8220;I cannot move about
in the river on account of my great length and bulk.
Take me quickly to the Ocean.&#8221; Manu was enabled to
carry the fish from the Ganges to the sea, and then it
spoke with a smile and said:</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Know thou, O worshipful one, my protector, that the dissolution
of the Universe is at hand. The time is ripe for purging
the world. I will therefore advise thee what thou shouldst do,
so that it may be well with thee. Build a strong and massive ark,
and furnish it with a long rope; thou wilt ascend in it with the
seven Rishis (the Celestial Rishis), and take with thee all the different
seeds enumerated by Brahmans in days of yore, and preserve
them carefully. Wait for me and I will appear as a horned animal.
Act according to my instructions, for without mine aid thou canst
not save thyself from the terrible deluge.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Manu gathered together all the different seeds and &#8220;set
sail in an excellent vessel on the surging sea&#8221;. He thought
of the fish, and it arose out of the waters like an island;
he cast a noose which he fastened to the horns on its head,
and the fish towed the ark over the roaring sea; tossed
by the billows the vessel reeled about like one who is drunk.
No land was in sight. &#8220;There was water everywhere,
and the waters covered the heaven and the firmament
also.... When the world was thus flooded none but
Manu, the seven Rishis, and the fish could be seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>After many long years the vessel was towed to the
highest peak of the Himavat, which is still called Nau-bandhana
(the harbour), and it was made fast there. The
fish then spoke and said: &#8220;I am Brahma, the Lord of all
Creatures; there is none greater than me. I have saved
thee from this cataclysm. Manu will create again all
beings&mdash;gods, Asuras, and men, and all those divisions
of creation which have the power of locomotion and
which have it not. By practising severe austerities he
will acquire this power....&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Manu set about creating all beings in proper
and exact order.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>Markandeya elsewhere described the universal cataclysm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
with more detail. After a drought lasting for
many years, seven blazing suns will appear in the firmament;
they will drink up all the waters. Then wind-driven
fire will sweep over the earth, consuming all
things; penetrating to the nether world it will destroy
what is there in a moment; it will burn up the Universe.
Afterwards many-coloured and brilliant clouds will collect
in the sky, looking like herds of elephants decked with
wreaths of lightning. Suddenly they will burst asunder,
and rain will fall incessantly for twelve years until the
whole world with its mountains and forests is covered
with water. The clouds will vanish. Then the Self-created
Lord, the First Cause of everything, will absorb
the winds and go to sleep. The Universe will become
one dread expanse of water.</p>

<p>Account has to be taken of the persistent legend regarding
the ambrosia which gave strength to the gods
and prolonged their existence. In &#8220;Teutonic mythology&#8221;
it is snatched by Odin from the giants of the Underworld,
and is concealed in the moon, which is ever pursued by
the demon wolf Managarm, who seeks to devour it.</p>

<p>The development of the Indian form of the myth is
found in the story of &#8220;The Churning of the Ocean&#8221;,
which is dealt with in the <i>Mahábhárata</i>, the <i>Ramáyana</i>,
and several of the <i>Puranas</i>.</p>

<p>According to the epics, the ambrosia, the Indian name
of which is amrita (both words implying immortality),
was required by the gods so as to enable them to overcome
the demons. In <i>Vishnu Parva</i>, however, a Brahmanic
addition to the myth was made so as to exalt a
sage and illustrate the power he could exercise over the
old Vedic deities. It is related that Durvásas obtained
from a merry nymph a sweet-scented, inspiring garland
which made him dance. He presented it to Indra, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
placed it on the head of his elephant. The elephant
then began to prance about, and grew so excited that it
cast the garland on the ground. Durvásas was enraged
because that his gift was slighted in this manner, and
cursed Indra and foretold the ruin of his kingdom.
Thereafter the king of the gods began to suffer loss of
power, whereat the other deities became alarmed, fearing
that the demons would overcome him in battle. Appeal
was made to Brahma, who referred the gods to Vishnu,
the Preserver. That supreme being commanded that the
ocean should be churned for amrita.</p>

<p>In the epics the gods allied themselves with the
demons to procure amrita from Vishnu's Sea of Milk.
The &#8220;churning stick&#8221; was the mountain Mandara, and the
&#8220;churning rope&#8221; the serpent Vasuka<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> (Ananta or Shesha).
Vishnu said: &#8220;The demons must share in the work of
churning, but I will prevent them from tasting of the
amrita, which must be kept for Indra and the gods only.&#8221;</p>

<p>The gods carried the mountain Mandara to the ocean,
and placed it on the back of Kurma, the king of tortoises,
who was an incarnation of Vishnu.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> Round the mountain
they twisted the serpent, which was &#8220;a part of a part of
Vishnu&#8221;, the Asuras holding its hood and the gods its tail.
As a result of the friction caused by the churning, masses
of vapour issued from the serpent's mouth which, becoming
clouds charged with lightning, poured down refreshing
rains on the weary workers. Fire darted forth and
enwrapped the mountain, burning its trees and destroying
many birds, and the lions and elephants that crouched on
its slopes. In time the Sea of Milk produced butter
flavoured by the gums and juices which dropped from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>the mountain. The gods grew weary, but Vishnu gave
them fresh strength to proceed with the work. At length
the moon emerged from the ocean; then arose the
Apsaras, who became nymphs in Indra's heaven; they
were followed by the goddess Lakshmi, Vishnu's white
steed, and the gleaming gem which the god wears on his
breast. Then came Dhanwantari, the physician of the
gods, who carried a golden cup brimming with amrita.
Beholding him, the Asuras cried out: &#8220;The gods have
taken all else; the physician must be ours.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next arose the great elephant Airávata, which Indra
took for himself. The churning still went on until the
blue, devastating poison appeared and began to flow over
the earth, blazing like a flame mixed with fumes. To
save the world from destruction, Shiva swallowed the
poison and held it in his throat. From that time he was
called Nilakantha, &#8220;the blue-throated&#8221;.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the demons desired to combat against the
gods for the possession of the beautiful goddess Lakshmi
and the amrita. But Vishnu assumed a bewitching female
form, and so charmed the Asuras that they presented the
amrita to that fair woman.</p>

<p>Vishnu immediately gave the amrita to the gods, but
soon it was discovered that a demon named Rahu had
assumed Celestial form with purpose to drink it. The
amrita had only reached his throat when the sun and
moon discovered him and informed Vishnu. The divine
Preserver then flung his discus and cut off Rahu's huge
head, which resembled a mountain peak. Rendered
immortal by the amrita the head soared to the sky, roaring
loud and long. From that day Rahu's head, with
mouth agape, has followed sun and moon, and when he
swallows one or the other he causes the eclipses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the demons fought against the gods, but
were defeated, although they flung rocks and mountains.
Thousands were slain by the sky-scouring discus of
Vishnu, and those who survived concealed themselves in
the bowels of the earth and the depths of the ocean of
salt waters.</p>

<p>Once upon a time the ambrosia was robbed from the
gods by Gar´uda, half giant and half eagle, the enemy of
serpents. This &#8220;lord of birds&#8221; was hatched from an
enormous egg five hundred years after it had been laid by
Diti, mother of giants; his father was Kas´yapa, a Brahman
identified with the Pole Star, who had sacrificed with
desire for offspring. It happened that Diti, having lost
a wager, was put under bondage by the demons, and could
not be released until she caused the amrita to be taken
from a Celestial mountain where it was surrounded by
terrible flames, moved by violent winds, which leapt up
to the sky. Assuming a golden body, bright as the sun,
Garuda drank up many rivers and extinguished the fire.
A fiercely revolving wheel, sharp-edged and brilliant, protected
the amrita, but Garuda diminished his body and
entered between the spokes. Two fire-spitting snakes
had next to be overcome. Garuda blinded them with
dust and cut them to pieces. Then, having broken the
revolving wheel, that bright sky-ranger flew forth with
the amrita which was contained in the moon goblet.</p>

<p>The gods went in pursuit of Garuda. Indra flung
his thunderbolt, but the bird suffered no pain and dropped
but a single feather. When he delivered the amrita to
the demons his mother was released, but ere the demons
could drink Indra snatched up the golden moon-goblet
and wended back to the heavens. The demon snakes
licked the grass where the goblet had been placed by
Garuda, and their tongues were divided. From that day
all the snakes have had divided tongues.... Garuda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
became afterwards the vehicle of Vishnu; he has ever
&#8220;mocked the wind with his fleetness&#8221;.</p>

<p>Shiva, as we have indicated, developed from Rudra,
the storm god. He is first mentioned as Mahadeva, &#8220;the
great god&#8221;, in the <i>Yajurveda</i>, and in the <i>Mahábhárata</i> he
is sometimes exalted above Vishnu. In one part he is
worshipped by Krishna. He is the &#8220;blue-necked, three-eyed
trident-bearing lord of all creatures&#8221;. The trident
is a lightning symbol which appears to have developed
from the three wriggling flashes held in the left hand of
hammer-gods like Tarku and Rammon. Shiva's third
eye was on his forehead, and from it issued on occasion
a flame of fire which could consume an enemy; once he
slew Kamadeva, the love god, who wounded him with
flowery arrows, by causing the flame to spring forth.</p>

<p>Balor, the night god of Irish mythology, had similarly
a destroying eye; &#8220;its gaze withered all who stood before
it&#8221;;<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> he was the god of lightning and death, the &#8220;eye-flame&#8221;
being the thunderbolt.</p>

<p>Shiva's dwelling is on the Himalayan mount Kaila´sa<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>.
He is Girisha, &#8220;the lord of the hills&#8221;, and Chandra-Shekara,
&#8220;the moon crested&#8221;, Bhuteswara, &#8220;lord of
goblins&#8221;, and Sri Kanta, &#8220;beautiful throated&#8221;. When
he is depicted with five heads, he is regarded as the source
of the five sacred rivers flowing from the mountains. As
the god with snow-white face, he is the spirit of asceticism
(Maha-Yogi) adored by Brahmans performing penances.
In the <i>Mahábhárata</i> Arjuna, the warrior, invoked him by
engaging in austerities until smoke issued from the earth.
Then Shiva, &#8220;the illustrious Hara&#8221;, appeared in huge
and stalwart form and wrestled with him. Arjuna's limbs
were bruised and he was deprived of his senses. When
he recovered he hailed the god, saying:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> &#8220;Thou art
Shiva in the form of Vishnu and Vishnu in the form of
Shiva....<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> O Hari, O Rudra, I bow to thee. Thou
hast a (red) eye on thy forehead.... Thou art the
source of universal blessing, the cause of the cause of
the Universe.... Thou art worshipped of all the worlds.
I worship thee to obtain thy grace.... This combat in
which I was engaged with thee (arose) from ignorance....
I seek thy protection. Pardon me all I have done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shiva, whose sign is the bull, embraced Arjuna and
said, &#8220;I have pardoned thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>The god was invoked by another warrior, Ashwattaman,
son of Drona. Having naught else to sacrifice, the
worshipper flung himself upon the altar fire; Shiva accepted
him and entered his body so as to assist him
in slaughtering his sleeping enemies. Bloody rites were
at one time associated with Shiva worship. As the Destroyer
of the Hindu Trinity, he is armed with a discus,
a sword, a bow, and a club; but his most terrible weapon
is the trident. Sometimes he is clad in the skin of an
elephant and sometimes in that of a leopard, the tail
dangling behind. A serpent, coiled on his head, rears
itself to strike; another serpent darts from his right
shoulder against an enemy.</p>

<p>The bull symbol, Nandi, the moon crescent on his
forehead, and the serpent girdle, indicate that Shiva is a
god of fertility. A phallic symbol is associated with his
worship. In localities he is adored at the present day in
the form of a great boulder painted red which usually
stands below a tree. Offerings are made to this stone,
and women visit it during the period of the moon's increase
to pray for offspring.</p>

<p>As Natesa, the dancer, Shiva dances triumphantly on
the body of a slain Asura. A fine bronze in the Madras<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
Museum depicts him with four arms, and a beaming,
benevolent face, wearing a tiara, and surrounded by a
halo of fire; he absorbed the attributes of Agni as well as
those of Rudra. He is the destroyer of evil and disease,
the giver of long life and the god of medicine, and is
accordingly invoked to cure sickness. Victims of epilepsy
are believed to be possessed by Shiva.</p>

<p>In early Puranic times, when Brahmanism was revived
and reformed, the worship of goddesses came into prominence.
This was one of the most pronounced features
of the anti-Buddhist movement, and was due probably
to the influence of Great Mother worshippers. In the
Vedic Age, as we have seen, the goddesses were vague
and shadowy; as wives of the gods they were strictly
subordinate, reflecting, no doubt, the social customs
which prevailed among the Aryans. Ushas, the dawn,
and Ratri, the night, were mainly poetic conceptions.
Even Prithivi, the Earth Mother, who was symbolized
as a cow, played no prominent part in Vedic religion: a
magical influence was exercised by water goddesses. The
male origin of life appears to have been an accepted tenet
of Vedic belief. Aditi, mother of the Adityas, is believed
to be of more recent origin than her sons. Indra seems
to have similarly had existence before his mother, like the
other hammer gods, and especially P'an Ku and Ptah.</p>

<p>Female water spirits are invariably regarded as givers
of boons, inspiration and wisdom; holy wells have from
remote times been regarded as sources of luck; by performing
ceremonial acts those who visit them obtain what
they wish for in silence; their waters have, withal, curative
properties, or they may be used for purposes of divination.
The name of the goddess Saraswati signifies
&#8220;waters&#8221;; she was originally the spirit of the Saraswati
river, and was probably identical with Bharati, the goddess
of the Vedic Bharata tribe. In Puranic times she became
the wife of Brahma and the Minerva of the Hindu
Pantheon. She is identical with Vach, &#8220;Mother of the
Vedas&#8221;, the goddess of poetry and eloquence, and Viraj,
the female form of Purusha, who divided himself to give
origin to the gods and demons and all living creatures.
When Brahma took for a second wife Gayatri, the milkmaid,
she cursed him so that he could only be worshipped
once a year.</p>

<p>Saranyu, who may have developed from Ushas, the
Dawn, is the bride of Surya, the sun god, and mother of
the twin Aswins; she fashioned the trident of Shiva and
the discus of Vishnu, and other weapons besides.</p>

<p>Lakshmi, or Sri, who had her origin at the Churning
of the Ocean, became the wife of Vishnu, and the goddess
of beauty, love, and prosperity. She has had several
human incarnations, and in each case was loved by the
incarnation of Vishnu. She is Sita in the Ramáyana, and
the beautiful herdswoman beloved by Krishna. Lakshmi
is &#8220;the world-mother, eternal, imperishable; as Vishnu
is all-pervading, she is omnipresent. Vishnu is meaning,
she is speech; Vishnu is righteousness, she is devotion;
Sri is the earth, and Vishnu is the support of the earth.&#8221;
This benevolent goddess is usually depicted as a golden
lady with four arms, seated on a lotus.</p>

<p>Shiva's complex character is reflected in the various
forms assumed by his bride. As the Destroyer he is
associated with Durga, who has great beauty and is also
a war goddess. As Kali she is the black earth-mother,
and as Jagadgauri, the yellow woman, the harvest bride.
Armed with Celestial weapons, Durga is a renowned slayer
of demons. In her Kali form she is of hideous aspect.
Sculptors and painters have depicted her standing on the
prostrate form of Shiva and grinning with outstretched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
tongue. Her body is smeared with blood because she
has waged a ferocious and successful war against the
giants. Like Shiva, she has a flaming third eye on her
forehead. Her body is naked save for a girdle of giants'
hands suspended from her waist; round her neck she
wears a long necklace of giants' skulls: like the Egyptian
Isis, Kali can conceal herself in her long and abundant
hair. She has four arms: in one she holds a weapon,
and in another the dripping head of a giant; two empty
hands are raised to bless her worshippers. Like the
Egyptian Hathor or Sekhet, the &#8220;Eye of Ra&#8221;, she
goes forth to slay the enemies of the gods, rejoicing in
slaughter. Like Hathor, too, she is asked to desist, but
heeds not. Then Shiva approaches her and lies down
among her victims. Kali dances over the battlefield and
leaps on her husband's body. When she observes, however,
what she has done, she ejects her tongue with shame.</p>

<p>As Sati, Shiva's wife is the ideal of a true and virtuous
Hindu woman. When Sati's husband was slighted by
her father, the Deva-rishi, Daksha, she cast herself on
the sacrificial fire. Widows who died on the funeral
pyres of their husbands were called Sati<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>, because in performing
this rite they imitated the faithful goddess.</p>

<p>Sati was reborn as Uma, &#8220;Light&#8221;, the impersonation of
divine wisdom; as Amvika the same goddess was a sister
of Rudra, or his female counterpart, Rudra taking the place
of Purusha, the first man. Par´vati was another form of
the many-sided goddess. Shiva taunted her for being black,
and she went away for a time and engaged in austerities,
with the result that she assumed a golden complexion.</p>

<p>A trinity of goddesses is formed by Saraswati, the
white one, Lakshmi, the red one, and Par´vati, the black
one. The three were originally one&mdash;a goddess who
came into existence when Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva
spoke of the dreaded Asura, Andhaka (Darkness) and
looked one at another. The goddess was coloured white,
red, and black, and divided herself, according to the
Varaha Purana, into three forms representing the Past,
Present, and Future.</p>

<p>It was after Sati burned herself that the sorrowing
Shiva was wounded by Kamadeva, the love god, whom
he slew by causing a flame of fire to dart from his third
eye. This god is the son of Vishnu and Lakshmi. He
is usually depicted as a comely youth like the Egyptian
Khonsu; he shoots flowery arrows from his bow; his wife
Rati symbolizes Spring, the cuckoo, the humming bee, and
soft winds. As Manmatha he is the &#8220;mind-disturber&#8221;;
as Mara, &#8220;the wounder&#8221;; as Madan, &#8220;he who makes one
love-drunk&#8221;; and as Pradyumna he is the &#8220;all-conqueror&#8221;.</p>

<p>Gane´sa<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>, the four-armed, elephant-headed god of wisdom,
is the son of Shiva and Parvati. He is the general
of Shiva's army, the patron of learning and the giver of
good fortune. At the beginning of books he is invoked
by poets, his image is placed on the ground when a new
house is built, and he is honoured before a journey is
begun or any business is undertaken. The elephant's
head is an emblem of sagacity. A myth in one of the
Puranas relates that the planet Saturn, being under a
curse, decapitated Ganesa simply by looking at him.
Vishnu mounted on the back of the man-eagle Garuda
and came to the child's aid. He cut off the head of
Indra's elephant and placed it on Ganesa's neck. In a
conflict with a Deva-rishi Ganesa lost one of his tusks.
Several myths have gathered round this popular, elephant-headed
deity, who is also identified with the wise rat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>Another son of Shiva and Parvati is Kartikeya, the
Celestial general and slayer of demons. He is also
regarded as the son of Agni and the Ganges.</p>

<p>The goddess of the Ganges is Gangá. This most
sacred of all Indian rivers, the cleanser of sins and the
giver of immortality, was originally confined to the
Celestial regions, where it flowed from a toe of Vishnu.
How it came to earth is related in the following myth:
Sag´ara, a King of Ayodha (Oude), had great desire for
offspring. He performed penance, with the result that
one wife became the mother of a single son and the other
of sixty thousand sons. He prepared to perform a horse
sacrifice, but Indra stole the sacred animal. All the sons
went in search of it by digging each for the depth of
a league towards the centre of the earth. They were,
however, consumed by the fire of Kapila, a form of
Vishnu, who protected the earth goddess, his bride.
Sagara was informed that his sons would come to life
again and rise to heaven when the Ganges flowed down
to the earth. His grandson went through rigid penances,
and at length Brahma consented to grant the prayer that
the sacred river should descend from the Himalayas.
Shiva broke the fall of the waters by allowing them to
flow through his hair, and they were divided into seven
streams. When the waters reached the ashes of the slain
princes, their spirits rose to heaven and secured eternal
bliss. Sagra island, at the mouth of the Ganges, is
invested with great sanctity, on account of its association
with the King of Ayodha of this legend. All the Indian
rivers are female, with the exception of the Sona and
Brahmaputra, the spirits of which are male.</p>

<p>Other goddesses include Man´asa, sister of Vasuka,
King of the Nagas, who gives protection against snake
bites, and is invoked by the serpent worshippers: Sasti,
the feline goddess of maternity and protectress of children,
who rides on a cat; and Shitala, the Bengali goddess
of smallpox, who is mounted on an ass, carries a
bundle of reeds in her hand, and is clad in red; she is
propitiated on behalf of victims of the dreaded disease.</p>

<p>A prominent part is played in the Brahmanic mythology
of the Restoration period by the Deva-rishis,
the deified Vedic poets, sages, and priests, who stand
between the Vedic gods and the Trinity of Brahma,
Vishnu, and Shiva.</p>

<p>Originally there were seven Deva-rishis, and these
were identified with the seven stars of the Great Bear,
their wives being represented by the Pleiades. Their
number was, however, increased in time.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> Sometimes
they visit the earth in the form of swans, but more often
they are brooding sages who curse gods and mortals on
receiving the slightest provocation.</p>

<p>One of the most prominent of these Rishis is Na´rada<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>,
who cursed and was cursed by Brahma. In the <i>Mahábhárata</i>
he is a renowned teacher and a counsellor of kings,
and also a messenger between Indra and heroes. He is
a patron of music, and invented the Vina (lute) on which
he loves to play. His great rival is Parvata, who also
acts as a Celestial messenger.</p>

<p>Daksha is the father of Sati, the peerless wife of
Shiva. It was on account of this rishi's quarrel with
her husband, who was not invited to a great feast, that
she flung herself upon the sacrificial fire. Shiva cut off
Daksha's head and replaced it with the head of a goat.</p>

<p>Bhrigu was the patriarch of a Vedic priestly family.
He married a daughter of Daksha, and was the father of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>Lakshmi, wife of Vishnu, who rose from the ocean of
milk. Bhrigu once cursed Agni, whom he compelled
to consume everything. Angiras, Kratu, and Pulaha
were Deva-rishis who also married daughters of Daksha.
Pulastya was a famous slayer of Rakshasas. He once
cursed a king who refused to make way for him on a
narrow forest path, and the king became a Rakshasa.</p>

<p>Marichi was the grandfather of the dwarf incarnation
of Vishnu, and Atri was the father of the irascible sage
Durvasas, a master curser.</p>

<p>Vasishtha is sometimes referred to as identical with
Vyasa, the reputed arranger of the Vedas, and author of
the <i>Mahábhárata</i>. He possessed a wonderful cow which
granted whatever he wished for. A king named Vishwamitra
desired to possess this wonderful animal, and when
he found that he was unable to obtain it by force, he determined
to raise himself from the Kshatriya to the Brahman
caste by performing prolonged austerities. When
Vishwamitra secured this elevation he fought with his rival.</p>

<p>Some Vedic scholars regard Vishwamitra and Vasishtha
as actual historical personages. They argue that Vishwamitra
was originally a Purohita (family priest) in the
service of Sudas, the king of an Aryan tribe called the
Tritsus. References are found in the <i>Rigveda</i> to the
wars of Sudas, who once defeated a coalition of ten
kings. Vishwamitra is believed to have been deposed
by Sudas in favour of Vasishtha, and to have allied himself
afterwards with the enemies of the Tritsus.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>Professor Oldenberg, the German Sanskrit scholar, is
convinced, however, that there is no evidence in the
<i>Rigveda</i> of the legendary rivalry between Vishwamitra
and Vasishtha. He regards the Vasishthas as the family
priests of the Bharata tribe and identical with the Tritsus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the tribes which opposed the advance of the
conquering King Sudas, who appears to have been a
late comer, was the Puru people on the banks of the
Saraswati river. We find that the early authors suddenly
cease to refer to them, and the problem is presented:
What fate had befallen the Purus? Professor Oldenberg,
whose view is accepted by Professor Macdonell, Oxford,
explains that the Purus merged in the Kuru coalition.
The Kurus gave their name to Kuru-kshetra, the famous
battlefield of the epic <i>Mahábhárata</i>; they had already
fused with the Panchala tribe and formed the Kuru-Panchala
nation in Madhyadesa, the &#8220;Middle Country&#8221;,
the home of Brahmanic culture, the birthplace of the
famous old <i>Upanishads</i>.</p>

<p>The Bharatas, and their priestly aristocracy of Tritsus,
the Vasishthas, appear to have joined the Kuru-Panchala
confederacy about the time that the <i>Brahmanas</i> were being
composed, and these were probably influenced by the
ritualistic practices of the Vasishthas. There are references
to Agni of the Bharatas, and a goddess Bharati
is mentioned in connection with the Saraswati river.</p>

<p>It appears highly probable that the Bharatas and the
Kuru-Panchalas represent late invasions of peoples who
displaced the earlier Aryan settlers in Hindustan. Among
the enemies of the invaders were the Kasis, a tribe which
became associated with Benares. It is not possible to
prove the theory that this people had any connection
with the Kassites who established a Dynasty at Babylon.
The Kassites are believed to be identical with the Cossæi
of later times, who were settled between Babylon and
the Median highlands. Some think the Kassites came
from Asia Minor after the Hittite raid on Babylon, if
the Kassites, as Hittite allies, were not the actual raiders.
The fact that the Maltese cross, which is found on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
Elamite neolithic pottery, first appears on Babylonian
seals during the Kassite Dynasty, suggests, however,
that the Kassites came from the east and not the west,
with the horse, called in Babylon &#8220;the ass of the east&#8221;.</p>

<p>The great epic <i>Mahábhárata</i>, &#8220;the Iliad of India&#8221;,
may have been founded on the hero songs which celebrated
the Aryan tribal wars in India. Its action is
centred in Kuru-kshetra, &#8220;the country of the Kurus&#8221;,
in which the Bharatas had settled. Two rival families
contend for supremacy; these are the Kauravas (the
Kurus) and the Pandavas who are supported by the
Panchalas and others. The Pandavas and Kauravas are
cousins and the descendants of the eponymous King
Bharata. In the royal family tree the tribal names of
Kuru and Puru appear as names of kings.</p>

<p>A popular rendering is given in several chapters which
follow of the epic narrative embedded in the <i>Mahábhárata</i>,
which is about eight times as long as the <i>Iliad</i>
and <i>Odyssey</i> combined. This monumental work is
divided into eighteen books; a supplementary nineteenth
book alone exceeds in length the two famous Greek epics.</p>

<p>As we have stated, the <i>Mahábhárata</i> had its origin as
an epic prior to <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 500. It was added to from time to
time until it assumed its present great bulk. The kernel
of the narrative, however, which appears to have dealt
with the early wars between the Kurus and Panchalas,
must be placed beyond <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 1000.</p>

<p>Our narrative begins with the romantic stories which
gathered round the names of the legendary ancestors of
the Kauravas and the Pandavas. The sympathies of the
Brahmanic compilers are with the latter, who are symbolized
as &#8220;a vast tree formed of religion and virtue&#8221;, while
their opponents are &#8220;a great tree formed of passion&#8221;.</p>

<p>Now the sire of the great King Bharata<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> was royal
Dushyanta of the lunar race, the descendant of Atri, the
Deva-rishi, and of Soma, the moon; his mother was
beautiful Shakuntala, the hermit maiden, and daughter
of a nymph from the celestial regions. And first be it
told of the wooing of Shakuntala and the strange childhood
of her mighty son.</p>

<p>One day King Dushyanta, that tiger among men,
went forth from his stately palace to go a-hunting with
a great host and many horses and elephants. He entered
a deep jungle and there slew numerous wild animals;
his arrows wounded tigers at a distance; he felled those
that came near with his great sword. Lions fled from
before him, wild elephants stampeded in terror, deer
sought to escape hastily, and birds rose in the air uttering
cries of distress.</p>

<p>The king, attended by a single follower, pursued a
deer across a desert plain, and entered a beautiful forest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>which delighted his heart, for it was deep and shady, and
was cooled by soft winds; sweet-throated birds sang in
the branches, and all round about there were blossoming
trees and blushing flowers; he heard the soft notes of the
kokila<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>, and beheld many a green bower carpeted with
grass and canopied by many-coloured creepers.</p>

<p>Dushyanta, abandoning the chase, wandered on until
he came to a delightful and secluded hermitage, where
he saw the sacred fire of that austere and high-souled
Brahman, the saintly Kanva. It was a scene of peace
and beauty. Blossoms from the trees covered the ground;
tall were the trunks, and the branches were far-sweeping.
A silvery stream went past, breaking on the banks
in milk-white foam; it was the sacred River Malini,
studded with green islands, loved by water fowl, and
abounding with fish.</p>

<p>Then the king was taken with desire to visit the holy
sage, Kanva, he who is without darkness. So he divested
himself of his royal insignia and entered the sacred grove
alone. Bees were humming; birds trilled their many
melodies; he heard the low chanting voices of Brahmans
among the trees&mdash;those holy men who can take captive
all human hearts....</p>

<p>When he reached the abode of Kanva, he wondered
to find that it was empty, and called out: &#8220;Who is
here?&#8221; and the forest echoed his voice.</p>

<p>Then came towards him a beautiful black-eyed virgin,
clad in a robe of bark. She reverenced the king and
said: &#8220;What seekest thou? I am thy servant.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said the royal Dushyanta to the maiden of faultless
form and gentle voice:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> &#8220;I have come to honour the wise
and blessed Kanva. Tell me, O fair and amiable one,
whither he hath gone?&#8221;</p>

<p>The maiden answered: &#8220;My illustrious sire is gathering
herbs, but if thou wilt tarry he will return ere
long.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dushyanta was entranced by the beauty and sweet
smiles of the gentle girl, and his heart was moved towards
her, for she was in the bloom of youth. So he
spake, saying: &#8220;Who art thou, O fairest one? Whence
comest thou, and why dost thou wander alone in the
woods? O comely maiden, thou hast taken captive my
heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bright-eyed one made answer: &#8220;I am the
daughter of the holy and high-souled Kanva, the ever-wise
and ever-constant.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said the king: &#8220;But Kanva is chaste and austere and
hath ever been a celibate, nor can he have broken his
rigid vow. How came it that thou wert born the
daughter of such a one?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the maiden, who was named Shakuntala, because
that the birds (shakunta) had nursed her, revealed
unto the king the secret of her birth. Her real sire was
Vishwamitra<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>, the holy sage who had been a Kshatriya
and was made a Brahman in reward for his austerities.
It came to pass that Indra became alarmed at his growing
power, and he feared that the mighty sage of blazing
energy would, by reason of his penances, cast down even
him, the king of the gods, from his heavenly seat. So
Indra commanded Menaka, the beauteous Ap'sara, to disturb
the holy meditations of the sage, for he had already
achieved such power that he created a second world and
many stars. The nymph called on the wind god and on
the god of love, and they went with her towards Vishwamitra.</p>

<p>Menaka danced before the brooding sage; then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
wind god snatched away her moon-white garments, and
the love god shot his arrows at Vishwamitra, whereupon
that saintly man was stricken with love for the nymph
of peerless beauty, and he wooed her and won her as his
bride. So was he diverted from his austerities. In time
Menaka became the mother of a girl babe, whom she cast
away on the river bank.</p>

<p>Now the forest was full of lions and tigers, but
vultures gathered round the infant and protected her from
harm. Then Kanva found and took pity on the child;
he said: &#8220;She will be mine own daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Shakuntala: &#8220;O king, I was that child who was
abandoned by the nymph, and now thou dost know how
Kanva came to be my sire.&#8221;</p>

<p>The king said: &#8220;Blessed are thy words, O princess.
Thou art of royal birth. Be thou my bride, O beautiful
maid, and thou wilt have garlands of gold and golden
ear-rings and white pearls and rich robes; my kingdom
also will be thine, O timid one; wed thou me in Gandharva
mode, which of all marriages is the best.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>Then Shakuntala promised to be the king's bride, on
condition that he would choose her son as the heir to his
throne.</p>

<p>&#8220;As thou desirest, so let it be,&#8221; said Dushyanta.
And the fair one became his bride.</p>

<p>Ere Dushyanta went away he promised Shakuntala
that he would send a mighty host to escort her to his
palace.</p>

<p>When Kanva returned, the maiden did not leave her
hiding-place to greet him; but he searched out and found
her, and he read her heart. &#8220;Thou hast not broken the
law,&#8221; he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> &#8220;Dushyanta, thine husband, is noble and
true, and a son will be born unto thee who will achieve
great renown.&#8221;</p>

<p>In time fair Shakuntala became the mother of a
comely boy, and the wheel mark<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> was on his hands.
He grew to be strong and brave, and when but six years
old he sported with young lions, for he was suckled by a
lioness; he rode on the backs of lions and tigers and wild
boars in the midst of the forest. He was called All-tamer,
because that he tamed everything.</p>

<p>Now when Kanva perceived that the boy was of
unequalled prowess, he spake to Shakuntala and said:
&#8220;The time hath come when he must be anointed as heir
to the throne.&#8221; So he bade his disciples to escort mother
and son unto the city of Gajasahvaya<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>, where Dushyanta
had his royal palace.</p>

<p>So it came that Shakuntala once again stood before
the king, and she said unto him: &#8220;Lo! I have brought
unto thee this thy son, O Dushyanta. Fulfil the promise
thou didst make aforetime, and let him be anointed as
thine heir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dushyanta had no pleasure in her words, and made
answer: &#8220;I have no memory of thee. Who are thou
and whence cometh thou, O wicked hermit woman? I
never took thee for wife, nor care I whether thou art to
linger here or to depart speedily.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stunned by his cold answer, the sorrowing Shakuntala
stood there like a log.... Soon her eyes became red
as copper and her lips trembled; she cast burning glances
at the monarch. For a time she was silent; then she
exclaimed with fervour:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> &#8220;O king without shame, well
dost thou know who I am. Why wilt thou deny knowledge
of me as if thou wert but an inferior person? Thy
heart is a witness against thee. Be not a robber of thine
own affections.... The gods behold everything: naught
is hidden from them; verily, they will not bless one who
doth degrade himself by speaking falsely regarding himself.
Spurn not the mother of thy son; spurn not thy
faithful wife. A true wife beareth a son; she is the first
of friends and the source of salvation; she enables her
husband to perform religious acts, her sweet speeches
bring him joy; she is a solace and a comforter in sickness
and in sorrow; she is a companion in this world and the
next. If a husband dies, a wife follows soon afterwards;
if she is gone before, she waiteth for her husband in
heaven. She is the mother of the son who performs the
funeral rite to secure everlasting bliss for his sire, rescuing
him from the hell called Put. Therefore a man should
reverence the mother of his son, and look upon his son
as if he beheld his own self in a mirror, rejoicing the
while as if he had found heaven.... Why, O king,
dost thou spurn thine own child? Even the ants will
protect their eggs; strangers far from home take the
children of others on their knees to be made happy,
but thou hast no compassion for this child, although he
is thy son, thine own image.... Alas! what sin did
I commit in my former state that I should have been
deserted by my parents and now by thee!... If I must
go hence, take thou thy son to thy bosom, O king.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Dushyanta: &#8220;It has been well said that all women
are liars. Who will believe thee? I know naught regarding
thee or thy son.... Begone! O wicked woman,
for thou art without shame.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shakuntala made answer, speaking boldly and without
fear:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> &#8220;O king, thou canst perceive the shortcomings of
others, although they may be as small as mustard seeds;
thou art blind to thine own sins, although they may be
big as Vilwa fruit. As the swine loveth dirt even in a
flower garden, so do the wicked perceive evil in all that
the good relate. Honest men refrain from speaking ill
of others: the wicked rejoice in scandal. O king! truth
is the chief of all virtues. Truth is God himself. Do
not break thy vow of truth: let truth be ever a part of
thee. But if thou wouldst rather be false, I must needs
depart, for, verily, such a one as thee should be avoided.... Yet
know now, O Dushyanta, that when thou art
gone, my son will be king of this world, which is surrounded
by the four seas and adorned by the monarch
of mountains.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shakuntala then turned from the king, but a voice
out of heaven spoke softly down the wind, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Shakuntala hath uttered what is true. Therefore, O
Dushyanta, cherish thy son, and became thou wilt cherish
him by command of the gods, let his name be Bharata (&#8216;the
cherished&#8217;)</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the king heard these words, he spoke to his
counsellors and said: &#8220;The celestial messenger hath
spoken.... Had I welcomed this my son by pledge of
Shakuntala alone, men would suspect the truth of her
words and doubt his royal birth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereafter Dushyanta embraced his son and kissed
him, and he honoured Shakuntala as his chief rani<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>; he
said to her, soothingly: &#8220;From all men have I concealed
our union; and for the sake of thine own good
name I hesitated to acknowledge thee. Forgive my harsh
words, as I forgive thine. Thou didst speak passionately
because thou lovest me well, O great-eyed and fair one,
whom I love also.&#8221;</p>

<p>The son of Shakuntala was then anointed as heir to
the throne, and he was named Bharata.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>When Dushyanta died, Bharata became king. Great
was his fame, as befitted a descendant of Chandra.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> He
was a mighty warrior, and none could withstand him in
battle; he made great conquests, and extended his kingdom
all over Hindustan, which was called Bharatavarsha.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>King Bharata was the sire of King Hastin, who built
the great city of Hastinapur; King Hastin begot King
Kuru, and King Kuru begot King Shantanu.</p>

<p>Be it told of the King Shantanu that he was pious
and just and all-powerful, as was meet for the great
grandson of King Bharata. His first wife was the goddess
Ganga of the Ganges river, and she was divinely
beautiful like to her kind. Ere she assumed human
form for a time, there came to her the eight Vasus, the
attendants of Indra. It chanced that when the Brahman
Vasishtha was engaged in his holy meditations the Vasus
flew between him and the sun, whereupon the angered
sage cursed them, saying: &#8220;Be born among men!&#8221; Nor
could they escape this fate, so great was the Rishi's power
over celestial beings. So they hastened to Ganga, and
she consented to become their human mother, promising
that she would cast them one by one into the Ganges
soon after birth, so that they might return speedily to
their celestial state. For this service Ganga made each
of the Vasus promise to confer an eighth part of his power
on her son, who, according to her desire, should remain
among men for many years, but would never marry or
have offspring.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>A day came thereafter when King Shantanu walked
beside the Ganges. Suddenly there appeared before him
a maiden of surpassing beauty. She was Ganga in human
form. Her celestial garments had the splendour of lotus
blooms; she was adorned with rare ornaments, and her
teeth were radiant as pearls. The king was silenced by
her charms, and gazed upon her steadfastly.... In time
he perceived that the maiden regarded him with love-lorn
eyes, as if she sought to look upon him for ever, and he
spoke to her, saying: &#8220;O slender-waisted and fair one, art
thou one of the Danavas, or art thou of the race of Gandharvas,
or art thou of the Apsaras; art thou one of the
Yakshas or Nagas,<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> or art thou of human kind, O peerless
and faultless one? Be thou my bride.&#8221;</p>

<p>The goddess made answer that she would wed the
king, but said she must needs at once depart from him
if he spoke harshly to her at any time, or attempted to
thwart her in doing as she willed. Shantanu consented
to her terms, and Ganga became his bride.</p>

<p>In time the goddess gave birth to a son, but soon
afterwards she cast him into the Ganges, saying: &#8220;This
for thy welfare.&#8221;</p>

<p>The king was stricken with horror, but he spake not
a word to his beautiful bride lest she should leave him.</p>

<p>So were seven babes, one after another, destroyed by
their mother in like manner. When the eighth was
born, the goddess sought to drown him also; but the
king's pent-up wrath broke forth in a torrent of speech,
and he upbraided his heartless wife. Thus was his
marriage vow broken, and Ganga given power to depart
unto her own place. But ere she went she revealed
unto the king who she was, and also why she had cast
the Vasus, her children, into the Ganges. Then she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
suddenly vanished from before his eyes, taking the last
babe with her.</p>

<p>Ere long the fair goddess returned to Shantanu for
a brief space, and she brought with her for the king a
fair and noble son, who was endowed with the virtues
of the Vasus. Then she departed never to come again.
The heart of Shantanu was moved towards the child,
who became a comely and powerful youth, and was
named Satanava.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>When Shantanu had grown old, he sought to marry
a young and beautiful bride whom he loved. For one
day as he walked beside the Jumna river he was attracted
by a sweet and alluring perfume, which drew him through
the trees until he beheld a maiden of celestial beauty with
luminous black eyes.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> The king spake to her and said:
&#8220;Who art thou, and whose daughter, O timid one? What
doest thou here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Said the maiden, blessing Shantanu: &#8220;I am the daughter
of a fisherman, and I ferry passengers across the river in
my boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, the name of this fair maiden was Satyavati.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
Like Shakuntala, she was of miraculous origin, and had
been adopted by her reputed sire. It chanced that a
fish once carried away in its stomach two unborn babes,
a girl and a boy, whose father was a great rajah. This
fish was caught by a fisherman, who opened it and found
the children. He sent the manchild unto the rajah and
kept the girl, who was reared as his own daughter. She
grew to be comely and fair, but a fishy odour ever clung
to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>One day, as she ferried pilgrims across the Jumna,
there entered her boat alone the high and pious Brahman
Parashara, who was moved by the maiden's great beauty.
He desired that she should become the mother of his
son, and promised that ever afterwards an alluring perfume
would emanate from her body. He then caused a
cloud to fall upon the boat, and it vanished from sight.</p>

<p>When the fisher girl became the mother of a son, he
grew suddenly before her eyes, and in a brief space was
a man. His name was Vyasa<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>; he bade his mother farewell,
and hastened to the depths of a forest to spend his
days in holy meditation. Ere he departed he said unto
Satyavati: &#8220;If ever thou hast need of me, think of me,
and I shall come to thine aid.&#8221;</p>

<p>When this wonder had been accomplished, Satyavati
became a virgin again through the power of the great
sage Parashara, and a delicious odour lingered about her
ever afterwards.</p>

<p>On this maiden King Shantanu gazed with love.
Then he sought the fisherman, and said he desired the
maiden to be his bride. But the man refused to give
his daughter to the king in marriage until he promised
that her son should be chosen as heir to the throne.
Shantanu could not consent to disinherit Satanava, son
of Ganga, and went away with a heavy heart.</p>

<p>Greatly the king sorrowed in his heart because of his
love for the dark-eyed maiden, and at length Satanava
was given his secret. Then that noble son of Ganga
went to search for the beautiful daughter of the fisherman,
and he found her. The fisherman said unto him,
when he had made known his mission:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> &#8220;If Satyavati
bears sons, they will not inherit the kingdom, for the king
hath already a son, and he will succeed him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Satanava thereupon made a vow renouncing his claim
to the throne, and said: &#8220;If thou wilt give thy daughter
unto my sire to be his queen, I, who am his heir, will
never accept the throne, nor marry a wife, or be the
father of children. If, then, Satyavati will become the
mother of a son, he will surely be chosen rajah.&#8221; When
he had spoken thus, the gods and Apsaras, the mist
fairies, caused flowers to fall out of heaven upon the
prince's head, and a voice came down the wind, saying:
&#8220;<i>This one is Bhishma.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>So from that day the son of Ganga was called
Bhishma, which signifies the &#8220;Terrible&#8221;, for the vow
that he had taken was terrible indeed.</p>

<p>Then was Satyavati given in marriage to the king,
and she bore him two sons, who were named Chitrangada
and Vichitra-virya.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>In time Shantanu sank under the burden of his years,
and his soul departed from his body. Unto Bhishma
was left the care of the queen-mother, Satyavati, and the
two princes.</p>

<p>When the days of mourning went past, Bhishma
renounced the throne in accordance with his vow, and
Chitrangada was proclaimed king. This youth was a
haughty ruler, and his reign was brief. He waged war
against the Gandhari of the hills<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> for three years, and was
slain in battle by their rajah. Then Bhishma placed
Vichitra-virya on the throne, and, as he was but a boy,
Bhishma ruled as regent for some years.</p>

<p>At length the time came for the young king to marry,
and Bhishma set out to find wives for him. It chanced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>that the King of Kasi (Benares) had three fair daughters
whose swayamvara<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> was being proclaimed. When Bhishma
was told of this he at once entered his chariot and drove
from Hastinapur<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> to Kasi to discover if the girls were
worthy of the monarch of Bharatavarsha. He found that
they had great beauty, and he was well pleased thereat.
The great city was thronged with rajahs who had gathered
from far and near to woo the maidens, but Bhishma
would not tarry until the day of the swayamvara. He
immediately seized the king's fair daughters and placed
them in his chariot. Then he challenged the assembled
rajahs and sons of rajahs in a voice like thunder, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;The sages have decreed that a king may give his
daughter with many gifts unto one he has invited when
she hath chosen him. Others may barter their daughters
for two kine, and some may give them in exchange for
gold. But maidens may also be taken captive. They
may be married by consent, or forced to consent, or be
obtained by sanction of their sires. Some are given
wives as reward for performing sacrifices, a form approved
by the sages. Kings ever favour the swayamvara, and
obtain wives according to its rules. But learned men
have declared that the wife who is to be most highly
esteemed is she who is taken captive after battle with
the royal guests who attend a swayamvara. Hear and
know, then, ye mighty rajahs, I will carry off these fair
daughters of the king of Kasi, and I challenge all who
are here to overcome me or else be overcome themselves
by me in battle.&#8221;</p>

<p>The royal guests who were there accepted the challenge,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>and Bhishma fought against them with great fury.
Bows were bent and ten thousand arrows were discharged
against him, but he broke their flight with innumerable
darts from his own mighty bow. Strong and brave was
he indeed; there was none who could overcome him; he
fought and conquered all, until not a rajah was left to
contend against him.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>Thus did Bhishma, the terrible son of the ocean-going
Ganga, take captive after battle the three fair
daughters of the King of Kasi; and he drove away with
them in his chariot towards Hastinapur.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>When he reached the royal palace he presented the
maidens unto Queen Satyavati, who was well pleased,
and at once gave many costly gifts to Bhishma. She
decided that the captives should become the wives of her
son, King Vichitra-virya.</p>

<p>Ere the wedding ceremony was held, the eldest
maiden, whose name was Amba, pleaded with the queen
to be set free, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been betrothed already by my sire unto the
Rajah of Sanva. Oh, send me unto him now, for I cannot
marry a second time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her prayer was granted, and Bhishma sent her with
an escort unto the Rajah of Sanva. Then the fair Amba
related unto him how she had been taken captive; but
the rajah exclaimed, with anger: &#8220;Thou hast already
dwelt in the house of a strange man, and I cannot take
thee for my wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>The maiden wept bitterly, and she knelt before the
monarch and said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> &#8220;No man hath wronged me, O
mighty rajah. Bhishma hath taken a terrible vow of
celibacy which he cannot break. If thou wilt not have
me for wife, I pray thee to take me as thy concubine, so
that I may dwell safely in thy palace.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the rajah spurned the beautiful maiden, and his
servants drove her from the palace and out of the city.
So was she compelled to seek refuge in the lonely forest,
and there she practised great austerities with purpose to
secure power to slay Bhishma, who had wronged her.
In the end she threw herself upon a pyre, so that she
might attain her desire in the next life.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>Her two sisters, Amvika and Amvalika, became the
wives of Vitchitra-virya, who loved them well; but his
days were brief, and he wasted away with sickness until
at length he died. No children were born to the king,
and his two widows mourned for him.</p>

<p>The heart of Queen Satyavati was stricken with grief
because that her two sons were dead, and there was left
no heir to the throne of King Bharata.</p>

<p>Now it was the custom in those days that a kinsman
should become the father of children to succeed the dead
king.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> So Queen Satyavati spake unto Bhishma, saying:
&#8220;Take thou the widows of my son and raise up sons
who will be as sons of the king.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Bhishma said: &#8220;That I cannot do, for have I
not vowed never to be the sire of any children.&#8221;</p>

<p>In her despair Satyavati then thought of her son
Vyasa, and he immediately appeared before her and consented
to do as was her desire.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>Now Vyasa was a mighty sage, but, by reason of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>austerities in his lonely jungle dwelling, he had grown
gaunt and repulsive of aspect so that women shrank
from before him; fearsome was he, indeed, to look upon.</p>

<p>Amvika closed her eyes with horror when she beheld
the sage, and she had a son who was born blind: he was
named Dhritarashtra. Amvalika turned pale with fear:
she had a son who was named Pandu, &#8220;the pale one&#8221;.</p>

<p>Satyavati desired that Vyasa should be the father of a
son who had no defect; but Amvika sent her handmaiden
unto him, and she bore a son who was called Vidura.
As it happened, Dharma, god of justice, was put under
the spell of a Rishi at this time, to be born among men,
and he chose Vidura to be his human incarnation.</p>

<p>The three children were reared by Bhishma, who was
regent over the kingdom, and was yet subject to Queen
Satyavati. He taught them the laws and trained them
as warriors. When the time came to select a king,
Dhritarashtra<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> was passed over because that he was blind,
and Vidura because of his humble birth, and Pandu, &#8220;the
pale one&#8221;, was set upon the throne.</p>

<p>King Pandu became a mighty monarch, and was renowned
as a warrior and a just ruler of his kingdom.
He married two wives: Pritha, who was chief rani, and
Madri<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>, whom he loved best.</p>

<p>Now Pritha was of celestial origin, for her mother
was a nymph; her father was a holy Brahman, and her
brother, Vasudeva, was the father of Krishna.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> When
but a babe she had been adopted by the Rajah of Shurasena,
whose kingdom was among the Vindhya mountains.
She was of pious heart, and ever showed reverence towards
holy men. Once there came to the palace the great
Rishi Durvasas, and she ministered unto him faithfully
by serving food at any hour he desired, and by kindling
the sacred fire in the sacrificial chamber. After his stay,
which was in length a full year, Durvasas, in reward for
her services, imparted to Pritha a powerful charm<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>virtue of which she could compel the love of a celestial
being. One day she had a vision of Surya, god of the
sun; she muttered the charm, and received him when he
drew nigh in the attire of a rajah, wearing the celestial
ear-rings. In secret she became in time the mother of his
son, Karna, who was equipped at birth with celestial ear-rings
and an invulnerable coat of mail, which had power
to grow as the wearer increased in stature. The child
had the eyes of a lion and the shoulders of a bull.</p>

<p>In her maidenly shame Pritha resolved to conceal her
new-born babe. So she wrapped him in soft sheets and,
laying under his head a costly pillow, placed him in a
basket of wicker-work which she had smeared over with
wax. Then, weeping bitterly, she set the basket afloat on
the river, saying: &#8220;O my babe, be thou protected by all
who are on land, and in the water, and in the sky, and
in the celestial regions! May all who see thee love thee!
May Varuna, god of the waters, shield thee from harm.
May thy father, the sun, give thee warmth!... I shall
know thee in days to come, wherever thou mayst be, by
thy coat of golden mail.... She who will find thee and
adopt thee will be surely blessed.... O my son, she who
will cherish thee will behold thee in youthful prime like
to a maned lion in Himalayan forests.&#8221;</p>

<p>The basket drifted down the River Aswa until it was
no longer seen by that lotus-eyed damsel, and at length it
reached the Jumna; the Jumna gave it to the Ganges,
and by that great and holy river it was borne unto the
country of Anga.... The child, lying in soft slumber,
was kept alive by reason of the virtues possessed by the
celestial armour and the ear-rings.</p>

<p>Now there was a woman of Anga who was named
Radha, and she had peerless beauty. Her husband was
Shatananda, the charioteer. Both husband and wife had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
for long sorrowed greatly because that they could not
obtain a son. One day, however, their wish was gratified.
It chanced that Radha went down to the river bank, and
she beheld the basket drifting on the waves. She caused
it to be brought ashore; and when it was uncovered, she
gazed with wonder upon a sleeping babe who was as fair
as the morning sun. Her heart was immediately filled
with great gladness, and she cried out: &#8220;The gods have
heard me at length, and they have sent unto me a son.&#8221;
So she adopted the babe and cherished him. And the
years went past, and Karna grew up and became a powerful
youth and a mighty bowman.</p>

<p>Pritha, who was comely to behold, chose King Pandu
at her swayamvara. Trembling with love, she placed the
flower garland upon his shoulders.</p>

<p>Madri came from the country of Madra<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>, and was
black-eyed and dusky-complexioned. She had been purchased
by Bhishma for the king with much gold, many
jewels and elephants and horses, as was the marriage
custom among her people.</p>

<p>The glories of King Bharata's reign were revived by
Pandu, who achieved great conquests and extended his
territory. He loved well to go a-hunting, and at length
he retired to the Himalaya mountains with his two wives
to pursue and slay deer. There, as fate had decreed, he
met with dire misfortune. One day he shot arrows at
two deer which he beheld sporting together; but they
were, as he discovered to his sorrow, a holy Brahman
and his wife in animal guise. The sage was wounded
mortally, and ere he died he assumed his wonted form,
and foretold that Pandu, whom he cursed, would die in
the arms of one of his wives.</p>

<p>The king was stricken with fear; he immediately took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>vows of celibacy, and gave all his possessions to Brahmans;
then he went away to live in a solitary place with his two
wives.</p>

<p>Some have told that Pandu never had children of his
own, and that the gods were the fathers of his wives'
great sons. Pritha was mother of Yudhishthira<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>, son of
Dharma, god of justice, and of Bhima, son of Vayu, the
wind god, and also of Arjuna<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>, son of mighty Indra,
monarch of heaven. Madri received from Pritha the
charm which Durvasas had given her, and she became
the mother of Nakula and Sahadeva, whose sires were
the twin Aswins, sons of Surya, the sun god. These
five princes were known as the Pandava brothers.</p>

<p>King Pandu was followed by his doom. One day, as
it chanced, he met with Madri, his favourite wife; they
wandered together in a forest, and when he clasped her
in his arms he immediately fell dead as the Brahman had
foretold.</p>

<p>His sons, the Pandava brothers, built his funeral pyre,
so that his soul might pass to heaven. Both Pritha and
Madri desired to be burned with him, and they debated
together which of them should follow her lord to the
region of the dead.</p>

<p>Said Pritha: &#8220;I must go hence with my lord. I was
his first wife and chief rani. O Madri, yield me his
body and rear our children together. O let me achieve
what must be achieved.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madri said: &#8220;Speak not so, for I should be the
chosen one. I was King Pandu's favourite wife, and he
died because that he loved me. O sister, if I survived
thee I should not be able to rear our children as thou
canst rear them. Do not refuse thy sanction to this
which is dear unto my heart.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>So they held dispute, nor could agree; but the
Brahmans, who heard them, said that Madri must be
burned with King Pandu, having been his favourite wife.
And so it came to pass that Madri laid herself on the
pyre, and she passed in flames with her beloved lord, that
bull among men.</p>

<p>Meanwhile King Pandu's blind brother, Dhritarashtra,
had ascended the throne to reign over the kingdom of
Bharatavarsha, with Bhishma as his regent, until the elder
of the young princes should come of age.</p>

<p>Dhritarashtra had taken for wife fair Gándhári, daughter
of the Rajah of Gándhára. When she was betrothed she
went unto the king with eyes blindfolded, and ever afterwards
she so appeared in his presence. She became
the mother of a hundred sons, the eldest of whom was
Duryodhana. These were the princes who were named
the Kauravas, after the country of Kuru-jangala.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>The widowed Pritha returned to Hastinapur with her
three sons and the two sons of Madri also. When she
told unto Dhritarashtra that Pandu his brother had died,
he wept and mourned greatly; then he bathed in holy
waters and poured forth the funeral oblation. The blind
king gave his protection to the five princes who were
Pandu's heirs.</p>

<p>So the Pandavas and Kauravas were reared together
in the royal palace at Hastinapur. Nor was favour shown
to one cousin more than another. The young princes
were trained to throw the stone and to cast the noose,
and they engaged lustily in wrestling bouts and practised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>boxing. As they grew up they shared work with the
king's men; they marked the young calves, and every
three years they counted and branded the cattle. Yet,
despite all that could be done, the two families lived at
enmity. Of all the young men Bhima<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>, of the Pandavas<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>,
was the most powerful, and Duryodhana<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>, the leader of
the Kauravas, was jealous of him. Bhima was ever the
victor in sports and contests. The Kauravas could ill
endure his triumphs, and at length they plotted among
themselves to accomplish his death.</p>

<p>It chanced that the young men had gone to dwell in
a royal palace on the banks of the Ganges. One day,
when they feasted together in the manner of warriors,
Duryodhana put poison in the food of Bhima, who soon
afterwards fell into a deep swoon and seemed to be dead.
Then Duryodhana bound him hand and foot and cast
him into the Ganges; his body was swallowed by the
waters.</p>

<p>But it was not fated that Bhima should thus perish.
As his body sank down, the fierce snakes, which are
called Nagas, attacked him; but their poison counteracted
the poison he had already swallowed, so that
he regained consciousness. Then, bursting his bonds,
he scattered the reptiles before him, and they fled in
terror.</p>

<p>Bhima found that he had sunk down to the city of
serpents, which is in the underworld. Vasuki, king of
the Nagas, having heard of his prowess, hastened towards
the young warrior, whom he desired greatly to
behold.</p>

<p>Bhima was welcomed by Aryaka, the great grandsire
of Pritha, who was a dweller in the underworld. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>was loved by Vasuki, who, for Aryaka's sake, offered
great gifts to fearless Bhima. But Aryaka chose rather
that the lad should be given a draught of strength which
contained the virtues of a thousand Nagas. By the king
of serpents was this great boon granted, and Bhima was
permitted to drain the bowl eight times. He immediately
fell into a deep slumber, which continued for the space of
eight days. Then he awoke, and the Nagas feasted him
ere he returned again unto his mother and his brethren,
who were mourning for him the while. Thus it fell that
Bhima triumphed over Duryodhana, for ever afterwards
he possessed the strength of a mighty giant. He related
unto his brothers all that had befallen him, but they
counselled him not to reveal his secret unto the Kauravas,
his cousins.</p>

<p>About this time the prudent Bhishma deemed that the
young men should be trained to bear arms; so he searched
far and wide for a preceptor who was at once a warrior
and a scholar, a pious and lofty-minded man, and a lover
of truth. Such was Drona, the brave and god-adoring
son of Bharadwaja. He was well pleased to have care of
the princes, and to give them instruction worthy of their
rank and martial origin.</p>

<p>Drona had no mother: his miraculous birth was
accomplished by a beautiful nymph, and his sire was
Bharadwaja, a most pious Brahman. Of similar origin
was Drupada<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>, son of a rajah named Prishata<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>. Drona and
Drupada were reared together like brothers by the wise
Bharadwaja, and it was the hope of both sires that their
sons would repeat their own lifelong friendship. But
when, after happy youth, they grew into manhood, fate
parted them. The rajah retired from the throne, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>Drupada ruled the kingdom of Panchala<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>. Bharadwaja
died soon afterwards, and Drona married a wife named
Kripa, who became the mother of his son Ashwatthama<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>.
The child was so named because at birth he uttered a cry
like to the neighing of a horse. Drona devoted himself
to rearing his son, while he accumulated the wisdom of
the sages and performed sacred rites with pious mind like
to his holy sire.</p>

<p>When the sage Jamadagni, son of Bhrigu, closed his
career, he bestowed his great wealth on the sons of
Brahmans. Drona received heavenly weapons and
power to wield them. Then he bethought him to visit
Drupada, the friend of his youth, and share his inheritance
with him.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>Drona stood before the rajah and exclaimed: &#8220;Behold
thy friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Drupada frowned; his eyes reddened with anger,
and for a while he sat in silence. At length he spoke
haughtily and said:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Brahman, it is nor wise nor fitting that thou shouldst
call me friend. What friendship can there be between
a luckless beggar and a mighty rajah?... I grant that
in youth such a bond united us, one to another, but it
has wasted away with the years. Do not think that the
friendship of youth endures for ever in human hearts;
it is weakened by time, and pride plucks it from one's
bosom. Friendship can exist only between equals as we
two once were, but no longer chance to be. Hear and
know! Rich and poor, wise and ignorant, warriors and
cowards, can never be friends; it is for those who are of
equal station to exercise mutual esteem.... Say, can a
Brahman respect one who is ignorant of the Vedas? Can
a warrior do other than despise one who cannot go forth
to battle in his rumbling chariot? Say, can a monarch
condescend to one who is far beneath him?... Begone,
then, thou dreamer! Forget the days and the thoughts
of the past.... I know thee not....&#8221;</p>

<p>Drona heard the harsh words of his old friend with
mute amaze. For a moment he paused. Then abruptly
he turned away, nor spake he in reply. His heart
burned with indignation as he hastened out of the
city.</p>

<p>In time he reached the city of Hastinapur, and
Bhishma bade him welcome. When Drona undertook
the training of the princes he said: &#8220;I will do as is thy
desire, O Bhishma, but on condition that when the young
men are become complete warriors they will help me
to fight against mine enemy, Drupada, the Rajah of
Panchala.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bhishma gave willing consent to this condition. Thereafter
Drona abode with his wife in the royal palace, and
his son Ashwatthama was trained with the Pandavas and
Kauravas. He became the family priest as well as the
instructor of the princes. And ere long the young men
were accomplished warriors, and deeply learned in wisdom
and in goodness.</p>

<p>Drona took most delight in the Pandavas. Yudhishthira
was trained as a spearman, but he was more renowned
as a scholar than for feats of arms. Arjuna surpassed
all others in warrior skill; he was of noble bearing, and
none like him could ride the steed, guide the elephant, or
drive the rattling chariot, nor could any other prince withstand
his battle charge or oppose him in single combat.
He was unequalled with javelin or dart, with battleaxe
or mace, and he became the most famous archer of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
day. Strong Bhima learned to wield the club, Nakula
acquired the secret of taming steeds, and Sahadeva became
a mighty swordsman, and acquired great knowledge of
astronomy.</p>

<p>Drona trained the Kauravas with diligence also, as
well as his own son, who was wise and brave; but among
all his pupils he loved Arjuna best, for he was the most
modest and the most perfect, the most fearless, and yet
the most obedient to his preceptor.</p>

<p>Duryodhana of the Kauravas was jealous of all the
Pandavas, and especially of Arjuna.</p>

<p>The fame of Drona as a preceptor was spread far and
wide, and the sons of many rajahs and warriors hastened
to Hastinapur to be instructed by him. All were welcomed
save one, and he was the son of the rajah of the
robber Bhils. This young man pleaded that he might
be trained as an archer, but without avail. Drona said:
&#8220;Are not the Bhils highwaymen and cattle-lifters? It
would be a sin, indeed, to impart unto one of them great
knowledge in the use of weapons.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he heard these words, the rajah's son was
stricken with grief, and he turned homeward. But he
resolved to become an accomplished warrior. So he
fashioned a clay image of Drona and worshipped it, and
wielded the bow before it until his fame as an archer was
noised abroad.</p>

<p>One day Drona went forth with the princes to hunt
in the Bhil kingdom. Their dog ran through the woods,
and it beheld the dark son of the rajah of the Bhils and
barked at him. Desiring to display his skill, the young
man shot seven arrows into the dog's mouth ere it could
be closed, and, moaning and bleeding, the animal returned
thus to the princes.</p>

<p>Wondering greatly, the princes searched for the greatly-skilled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
archer, and found him busy with his bow. They
spoke, saying: &#8220;Who art thou?&#8221; And the Bhil made
answer: &#8220;I am a pupil of Drona.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Drona was brought to the place, the young
man kissed his feet.</p>

<p>Said the wise preceptor: &#8220;If thou art my pupil, I
must receive my reward.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man made answer: &#8220;Command me, and I
will give thee whatsoever thou dost desire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Drona: &#8220;I should like to have the thumb of thy
right hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>The faithful prince of the Bhils did not hesitate to
obey his preceptor; with a cheerful face he severed his
thumb from his right hand and gave it to Drona.</p>

<p>After his wound had healed, the young man began to
draw his bow with his middle fingers, but found that he
had lost his surpassing skill, whereat Arjuna was made
happy.</p>

<p>All the other Bhil warriors who trained in archery
followed the prince's example and drew the bow with
their middle fingers, and this custom prevailed ever
afterwards amongst the tribe.</p>

<p>Now when all the Hastinapur princes had become
expert warriors, Drona addressed the blind king, as he
sat among his counsellors, and said: &#8220;O mighty rajah,
thy sons and the sons of thy brother Pandu have now
attained surpassing skill in arms, and they are fit to enter
the battlefield.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said the king, who was well pleased: &#8220;So thy task is
finished, O noble son of Bharadwaja? Let now a place
be made ready, in accordance with thy desire, so that the
princes may display their martial skill in the presence of
their peers and the common people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Drona, accompanied by Vidura, the king's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
brother, made choice of a wide and level plain on which
the Pandavas and Kauravas might perform their mighty
feats.</p>

<p>So be it next told of the great tournament on the
plain, and of the coming of illustrious Karna.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI_The_Tournament" id="CHAPTER_XI_The_Tournament">CHAPTER XI<br />The Tournament</a></h2>

<p class="blockcontents">A Brilliant Assembly&mdash;Princes display Feats of Arms&mdash;Mimic Warfare&mdash;Duryodhana
and Bhima&mdash;A Fierce Struggle&mdash;Arjuna's Wonderful Skill&mdash;Despondency

<p>On the day of the great tournament, vast multitudes of
people from all parts of the kingdom assembled round
the barriers on the wide plain. A scene of great splendour
was unfolded to their eyes. At dawn many flags and
garlands of flowers had been distributed round the enclosure;
they adorned the stately royal pavilion, which
was agleam with gold and jewels and hung with trophies
of war; they fluttered above the side galleries for the
lords and the ladies, and even among the clustering trees.
White tents for the warriors occupied a broad green space.
A great altar had been erected by Drona beside a cool,
transparent stream, on which to offer up sacrifices to the
gods.</p>

<p>From early morn the murmurous throng awaited the
coming of king and counsellors, and royal ladies, and
especially the mighty princes who were to display their
feats of arms and engage in mimic warfare. The bright
sun shone in beauty on that festal day.</p>

<p>The clarion notes of the instruments of war proclaimed
the coming of the king. Then entered the royal procession,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
and blind Dhritarashtra was led towards his throne
in the gleaming pavilion. With him came the fair queen
Gandhari, mother of the Kauravas, and stately Pritha,
widow of King Pandu, the mother of the Pandavas.
There followed in their train many high-born dames and
numerous sweet maidens renowned for their beauty.
When all these ladies, attired in many-coloured robes and
glittering with jewels and bright flowers, were mounting
the decorated galleries, they seemed like to goddesses and
heavenly nymphs ascending to the golden summit of the
mountain of Meru.... The trumpets were sounding
loud, and the clamour which arose from the surging
multitude of people of every caste and every age and
every tribe was like the voice of heaving ocean in sublime
tempest.</p>

<p>Next came venerable and white-haired Drona, robed
in white, with white sacrificial cord; his sandals were
white, and the garlands he wore were white also. His
valiant son, Aswatthama, followed him as the red planet
Mars follows the white moon in cloudless heaven. The
saintly preceptor advanced to the altar where the priestly
choir gathered, and offered up sacrifices to the gods and
chanted holy texts.</p>

<p>Then heralds sounded their trumpets as the youthful
princes entered in bright array, bejewelled and lightly
girded for exercise, their left arms bound with leather.
They were wearing breastplates; their quivers were slung
from their shoulders, and they carried stately bows and
gleaming swords. The princes filed in according to their
years, and Yudhishthira came first of all. Each saluted
Drona in turn and awaited his commands.</p>

<p>One by one the youthful warriors displayed their skill
at arms, while the vast crowd shouted their plaudits. The
regent Bhishma, sitting on the right side of the throne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
looked down with delight, and Vidura, sitting on the
left side, informed the sightless king of all that took
place.</p>

<p>The princes shot arrows at targets, first on foot and
then mounted on rapid steeds,<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> displaying great skill;
they also rode on elephants and in chariots, and their
arrows ever flew with unerring aim.</p>

<p>Next they engaged in mimic warfare, charging with
chariots and on elephants: swords clamoured on shields,
ponderous maces were wielded, and falchions shimmered
like to the flashes of lightning. The movements of the
princes, mounted and on foot, were rapid and graceful;
they were fearless in action and firm-footed, and greatly
skilled in thrust and parry.</p>

<p>But ere long the conflict was waged with more than
mimic fury. Proud Duryodhana and powerful Bhima
had sought one another and were drawn apart from their
peers. They towered on the plain with uplifted maces,
and they seemed like two rival elephants about to fight
for a mate. Then they charged with whirling weapons,
and the combat was terrible to behold.</p>

<p>Vidura pictured the conflict to blind Dhritarashtra,
as did Pritha also to the blindfolded Queen Gandhari.
Round the barriers the multitudes swayed and clamoured,
some favouring Duryodhana and others mighty Bhima.</p>

<p>The princes fought on, and their fury increased until
at length it seemed that one or the other would be slain.
But while yet the issue hung doubtful, Drona, whose
brow was troubled, marked with concern the menacing
crowd, which was suspended with hope and fear, and
seemed like an ocean shaken by fitful gusts of changing
wind. Then he interposed, bidding his son to separate
the angry combatants so that the turmoil might have end.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>The princes heard and obeyed, and they retired slowly
like ocean billows, tempest-swollen, falling apart.</p>

<p>To allay excitement, trumpet and drum were sounded
aloud. Then white-haired Drona stepped forward, and
in a voice like thunder summoned brave Arjuna to come
forth.</p>

<p>First of all the valiant hero performed a sacred rite.
Thereafter he came before the multitude in all his
splendour, clad in golden armour, like to a glorious
evening cloud. Modestly he strode, while trumpets
blared and the drums bellowed, and he seemed a very
god. He was girdled with jewels, and he carried a
mighty bow. As the people applauded and shouted his
praises, Pritha, his mother, looked down, and tears
dropped from her eyes. The blind king spake to
Vidura, saying: &#8220;Why are the multitudes shouting now
like to the tumultuous sea?&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Vidura: &#8220;The valiant son of Pritha hath come
forth in golden armour, and the people hail him with
joy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The blind monarch said: &#8220;I am well pleased. The
sons of Pritha sanctify the kingdom like to sacrificial
fires.&#8221;</p>

<p>Silence fell upon the people, and Drona bade his
favourite pupil to display his skill. Arjuna performed
wonders with magic arms; he created fire by the <i>Agneya</i>
weapon, water by the <i>Varuna</i> weapon, wind by the
<i>Vayavya</i> weapon, clouds by the <i>Paryanya</i> weapon, land
by the <i>Bhanma</i> weapon, and he caused mountains to
appear by the <i>Parvatya</i> weapon. Then by the <i>Antardhyana</i>
weapon he caused all these to vanish.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>Arjuna then set up for his target an iron image of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>a great boar, and at one bending of the bow he shot five
arrows into its gaping jaws. Wondrous was his skill.
Next he suspended a cow horn, which swayed constantly
in the wind, and discharged into its hollow with unerring
aim twenty rapid arrows. Heaven and earth resounded
with the plaudits of the people when he leapt into his
chariot and discharged clouds of arrows as he was driven
speedily round the grounds. Having thus displayed his
accomplishments as an archer, he drew his sword, which
he wielded so rapidly round and about that the people
thought they beheld lightning and heard thunder. Ere
he left the field he cast the noose with exceeding great
skill, capturing horses and cows and scampering deer at
a single throw. Then Drona embraced him, and the
people shouted his praises.</p>

<p>Great was the joy of the Pandavas as they rested
around Drona like to the stars that gather about the
white moon in heaven. The Kauravas were grouped
around Aswatthama as the gods gather beside Indra
when the giant Daityas threaten to assail high heaven.
Duryodhana's heart burned with jealous anger because
of the triumph achieved by Arjuna.</p>

<p>Evening came on, and it seemed that the tournament
was ended; the crowds began to melt away. Then, of
a sudden, a mighty tumult of plaudits broke forth, and
the loud din of weapons and clank of armour was heard
all over the place. Every eye immediately turned towards
the gate, and the warriors and the people beheld
approaching an unknown warrior, who shook his weapons
so that they rattled loudly.</p>

<p>So came mighty Karna, son of Surya, the sun god,
and of Pritha, the mother of the three Pandavas&mdash;Arjuna,
Bhima, and wise Yudhishthira. He was comely as a
shining god, clad in golden armour, and wearing celestial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
ear-rings. In his right hand he carried a great many-coloured
bow; his gleaming falchion was on his thigh.
Tall as a cliff he strode forward; he was an elephant in
his fury, a lion in his wrath; stately as a palm tree was
that tamer of foemen, so fearless and so proud, so dauntless
and so self-possessed.</p>

<p>He paused in the centre of the plain and surveyed
the people with pride. Stiffly he paid homage to Drona
and Kripa. Then he, the eldest son of Pritha, spake to
Pritha's youngest son, Arjuna, the brothers being unknown
one to another, and he said: &#8220;Whatever feats
thou hast performed this day with vain boast, Arjuna,
these will I accomplish and surpass, if Drona will permit
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice was like to thunder in heaven, and the
multitude of people sprang up and uttered cries of
wonder. Duryodhana and the other sons of Kuru heard
the challenge with glad hearts, but Arjuna remained
silent, while his eyes flashed fire.</p>

<p>Then Drona gave the warrior permission to display
his skill. Karna was well pleased, and he performed
every feat which had given Arjuna fame on that great
day.</p>

<p>Duryodhana proclaimed his joy with beaming countenance,
and he embraced Karna, whom he hailed as
&#8220;brother&#8221;, saying: &#8220;I bid thee welcome, thou mighty
warrior. Thou hast won the honours of the field. Demand
from me whatsoever thou dost desire in this kingdom,
and it will be given unto thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Karna: &#8220;Thy word is thy bond, O prince. All
I seek is to combat against Arjuna, whom I have equalled
so far. Fain would I win the victor's renown.&#8221;</p>

<p>Duryodhana said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> &#8220;Thou dost ask for a worthy
boon indeed. Be our ally, and let the enemy fear thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Arjuna was moved to great wrath, and cried out:
&#8220;Uninvited chief! Boasting thus, thou wouldst fain
be regarded as mine equal, but I will so deal with thee
that thou wilt die the death of a braggart who cometh
here an unbidden guest, speaking boastfully ere thou art
spoken to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Karna, answering proudly and calm: &#8220;Waste not
words, Arjuna, nor taunt me with coming hither uninvited.
The field of combat is free to all warriors; they
enter by their valour, and do not await until thou dost
call them; they win their places by strength and skill,
and their warrant is the sword. Wrathful speech is the
weapon of a coward. Do not boast of thy pastimes or
be vain of thy bloodless feats. Speak with thine arrows,
O Arjuna, until, in Drona's presence, mine will cause
all men to wonder, flying towards thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drona was stirred to wrath, and spake to Arjuna, saying:
&#8220;Canst thou hear him boast in this manner? I
give thee leave to fight him here and now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Arjuna at once strode forward, fully armed, and he
was supported by Drona and Bhishma. Duryodhana
and his band stood by Karna. Then the two warriors
prepared for single combat, but not in mimic warfare.</p>

<p>Thick clouds gathered in the sky; lightning flashed
and thunder pealed; the mighty Indra guarded his son
Arjuna, who stood in shadow. Surya, the sun god, cast
a shaft of light athwart the darkening plain, and Karna's
golden armour gleamed bright and fair.</p>

<p>The noble dames looked on, and some praised Arjuna
and others praised Karna. Pritha, the mother of both
heroes, was alone divided in her love. She knew
her firstborn by his voice and noble bearing and by his
armour, and her heart was torn with grief to behold the
two brothers ready to slay each other. A cloud blinded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
her eyes, and, uttering a low cry, she swooned where
she sat. Vidura sprinkled water on her face, and she
was revived. Then she wept bitterly because that she
could not reveal the secret of Karna's birth.</p>

<p>Kripa,<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> the foster-brother of Bhishma, performed the
duties of herald, and as Arjuna strode forth to combat
he proclaimed: &#8220;Behold! this is mighty Arjuna, of
Bharata's great line, son of Pandu and of Pritha, a prince
of valour and worth who will not shrink from battle.
Unknown and long-armed chief,&#8221; he said unto Karna,
&#8220;declare now thy name and lineage, the royal house
thou dost adorn, and the names of thy sire and thy
mother. Know thou that by the rules of single combat
the sons of kings cannot contend against low-born or
nameless rivals.&#8221;</p>

<p>Karna heard, but was silent. He hung his head like
the dew-laden lotus bloom; he could claim nor lineage or
high rank, as he believed, for he regarded the charioteer
of Anga as his sire.</p>

<p>Duryodhana, perceiving his discomfiture, cried out to
Kripa, saying: &#8220;Valour is not reckoned by birth but by
deeds. Karna hath already shown himself to be the peer
of princes. I now proclaim him the Rajah of Anga.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having spoken thus, the elder of the Kauravas led
Karna by the hand and placed him upon a throne, and the
red umbrella was held above his head. Brahmans chanted
the texts for the ceremony and anointed Karna as a king.
Then the fan was waved and the royal umbrella raised on
high, while the Kauravas shouted: &#8220;The rajah is crowned;
blessings on the rajah; honour to the valorous warrior!&#8221;</p>

<p>Robed in royal attire, Karna then spake to Duryodhana
and said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> &#8220;With generous heart thou hast conferred upon
me a kingdom. O prince, speak and say what service
thou wouldst have me to render unto thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Duryodhana: &#8220;But one boon do I ask of thee,
O king. Be my comrade and, O valiant warrior, be my
helper also.&#8221;</p>

<p>Karna said: &#8220;As thou desirest, so be it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Duryodhana and Karna embraced one another
to confirm their loyal friendship.</p>

<p>Lo! now a charioteer drew nigh; he was a scantily-clad
and wearied old man, and he stooped, leaning heavily
upon his staff. He was the aged sire of Karna, and rejoiced
in his heart to see his son so highly honoured
among princes. Karna cast aside his weapons, knelt
down, and kissed the old man's feet. The happy sire
embraced the crowned head of the warrior and wept
tears of love.</p>

<p>The Pandava brothers gazed upon father and son,
amused and scornful.... Bhima spake to Karna, saying:
&#8220;So thou, with such a sire, hast presumed to seek
combat with a Pandava!... Son of a charioteer, what
hast thou to do with weapons of war? Better were it
that thou shouldst find thee a goad and drive a bullock-cart
behind thy sire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Karna grew pale with wrath; his lips quivered, but
he answered not a word. He heaved a deep sigh and
looked towards the sun.</p>

<p>Then Duryodhana arose like a proud elephant and
spake to Bhima, saying:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> &#8220;Seek not with insults to give
sorrow unto a mighty hero. Taunts come ill from thee,
thou tiger-like chief. The proudest warrior may contend
against the most humble: a hero is known by his deeds.
Of Karna's birth we care naught. Hath Drona other
than humble lineage? 'Tis said, too, that thou and thy
brethren are not sons of Pandu, but of certain amorous
deities.... Look upon Karna, adorned with jewels and
in golden armour! Do hinds bring forth tigers?...
Karna was born to be a king; he hath come to rule by
reason of his valour and his worth. If any prince or
warrior among you will deny my words, hear and know,
now, that I will meet him in deadly combat.&#8221;</p>

<p>The assembled multitude heard these mighty words
with joy and shouted loud applause.</p>

<p>But darkness came on, and lamps were lit upon the
plain.... Drona and the sons of Pandu made offerings
at the altar, and the king and his counsellors, the noble
dames and the high-born maids, departed in silence to their
homes.... Then all the people deserted the barriers,
some shouting, &#8220;Arjuna hath triumphed;&#8221; others,
&#8220;Karna is victor;&#8221; and some also, &#8220;Duryodhana hath
won.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pritha had rejoiced in her heart to behold her noble
son crowned king....</p>

<p>Duryodhana walked by Karna's side and took him
away to his own palace, glad of heart, for he no longer
feared Arjuna's valour and skill at arms.</p>

<p>Even Yudhishthira doubted Arjuna's worth; he feared
that Karna was the greatest hero in the world of men.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII_First_Exile_of_the_Pandavas" id="CHAPTER_XII_First_Exile_of_the_Pandavas">CHAPTER XII<br />First Exile of the Pandavas</a></h2>

<p class="blockcontents">Princes' First Campaign&mdash;Kauravas driven back&mdash;Pandavas achieve
Victory&mdash;Drupada humbled by Drona&mdash;Panchala Kingdom divided&mdash;Pandava
Prince made &#8220;Little Rajah&#8221;&mdash;Duryodhana's Plot&mdash;Pandavas' First Exile&mdash;Their

<p>The Pandavas and Kauravas had now become accomplished
warriors, and Drona, their preceptor, claimed his
reward. So he spoke unto his pupils and said: &#8220;Go
forth against Drupada, Rajah of Panchala; smite him in
battle and bring him to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cousins could not agree to wage war together by
reason of their jealousies. So the Kauravas, led by Duryodhana,
were first to attack Drupada; they rode in
their chariots and invaded the hostile capital, and slaked
their thirst for battle. The warriors of Panchala arose
to fight; their shouting was like the roaring of lions, and
their arrows were showered as thickly as rain dropping
from the clouds. The Kauravas were defeated, and they
retired in disorder, uttering cries of despair.</p>

<p>The Pandavas then rushed against the enemies of
Drona. Arjuna swept forward in his chariot like to the
fire which consumeth all things at the end of time, and
he destroyed horses and cars and warriors. The battle-roar
of Bhima was like to the roar of ocean stricken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
by a tempest; wielding his mace, he struck down
elephants big as mountains, and many horses and
charioteers also, and he covered the ground with rivers
of blood; as a herdsman driveth his cattle before him,
so did Bhima drive before him with his mace the terror-stricken
hosts of Panchala.</p>

<p>Drupada endeavoured to turn the tide of battle; surrounded
by his mightiest men, he opposed Arjuna. Then
a great uproar arose among the Panchala forces, for as
the lion leaps upon the leader of a herd of elephants, so
did Arjuna rush against Drupada. A boastful warrior
intervened, but the strong Pandava overcame him, and
at length, after fierce fighting, Arjuna seized Drupada as
Garuda, king of birds,<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> seizeth a mighty snake after disturbing
the waters of the ocean.</p>

<p>The remnant of the Panchala host then broke and
fled, and the Pandavas began to lay waste the capital.
Arjuna, however, cried unto Bhima: &#8220;Remember that
Drupada is the kinsman of the Kauravas; therefore cease
slaying his warriors.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>Drupada was led before Drona, who, remembering
the proud words of the fallen rajah, spoke and said: &#8220;At
last I have conquered thy kingdom, and thy life is in
my hands. Is it thy desire now to revive our friendship?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drona smiled a little and continued thus: &#8220;Brahmans
are full of forgiveness; therefore have no fear for thy life,
O king. I have not forgotten that we were children
together. So once again I ask for thy friendship, and I
grant thee, unasked, the half of the kingdom; the other
half will be mine, and if it pleaseth thee we will be
friends.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>Said Drupada: &#8220;Thou art indeed noble and great.
I thank thee, and desire to be thy friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Drona took possession of half of the kingdom.
Drupada, who sorrowed greatly, went to rule the southern
Panchalas; he was convinced that he could not defeat
Drona by Kshatriya power alone, which is inferior to
Brahman power, and he resolved to discover means
whereby he might obtain a son who could overcome his
Brahman enemy.</p>

<p>Thereafterwards the Pandavas waged war against
neighbouring kings, and they extended the territory over
which the blind maharajah held sway.</p>

<p>The Kauravas were rendered more jealous than ever
by the successes achieved by the Pandavas, and also
because the people favoured them. Now Duryodhana
desired to become heir to the throne, but the elder prince
of the conquering Pandavas could not be set aside. In
the end Yudhishthira was chosen, although unwillingly,
by the blind king, and he became Yuva-rajah, &#8220;Little
Rajah&#8221;, supplanting Bhishma, who had been regent
during the minority. Yudhishthira, accordingly, ruled
over the kingdom, and he was honoured and beloved by
the people; for although he was not a mighty warrior
like Arjuna, or powerful like Bhima, he had great
wisdom, and he was ever just and merciful, and a lover
of truth.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>Duryodhana remonstrated with his blind father, the
maharajah, and he spoke to him, saying:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> &#8220;Why, O my
father, hast thou thus favoured the Pandavas and forgotten
thine own sons? Thou wert Pandu's elder brother,
and should have reigned before him. Now the children
of thy younger brother are to succeed thee. The kingdom
is thine own by right of birth, and thy sons are thine
heirs. Why, then, hast thou lowered us in the eyes of
thy subjects?&#8221;</p>

<p>Said the blind Dhritarashtra: &#8220;Duryodhana, my son,
know thou that Pandu, my brother, was the mightiest
ruler in the world. Could I, who have ever been blind,
have set him aside? His sons have great wisdom and
worth, and are loved by the people. How, then, could
I pass them over? Yudhishthira hath greater accomplishments
for governing than thou dost possess, my son.
How could I turn against him and banish him from my
council?&#8221;</p>

<p>Duryodhana said: &#8220;I do not acknowledge Yudhishthira's
superiority as a ruler of men. And this I know
full well, I could combat against half a score of Yudhishthiras
on the field of battle.... If, my father, thou
wilt set me aside and deny me my right to a share of
government in the kingdom, I will take mine own life
and thus end my sorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Dhritarashtra: &#8220;Be patient, O my son, nor give
way to thy vexation. If such is thy desire, I will divide
the kingdom between thee and Yudhishthira, so that no
jealousy may exist between you both.&#8221;</p>

<p>Duryodhana was well pleased, hearing these words, and
he said: &#8220;I agree, O my father, and will accept thine
offer. Let the Pandavas take their own land and rule
over it, and I and my brethren will remain at Hastinapur
with thee. If the Kauravas and Pandavas continue to
dwell here together, there will be conflicts and much
shedding of blood.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Dhritarashtra: &#8220;Neither Bhishma, the head of
our family, nor Vidura, my brother, nor Drona, thy preceptor,
will consent to the Pandavas being sent hence.&#8221;</p>

<p>Duryodhana made answer:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span> &#8220;Consult them not; they
are beneath thee, my sire. Command the Pandavas to
depart unto the city of Varanavartha<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> and dwell there;
when they have gone no one will speak to thee regarding
this matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dhritarashtra listened to his son and followed his
counsel. He commanded Yudhishthira to depart with
his brethren to the city of Varanavartha, rich in jewels
and gold, to dwell there until he recalled them. Accordingly
the Pandava brethren bade farewell to Dhritarashtra
and left Hastinapur, taking with them their mother, the
widowed queen Pritha, and went towards the city of
Varanavartha. The people of Hastinapur mourned for
them greatly.</p>

<p>Ere they departed, Vidura spoke to them in secret,
bidding them to be aware of the perils of fire. He
repeated a verse to Yudhishthira and said: &#8220;Put thy
trust in the man who will recite these words unto thee;
he will be thy deliverer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now Duryodhana had plotted with Shakuni, the
brother of Queen Gandhari, to accomplish the destruction
of his kinsmen. Then their ally, Kanika the Brahman, said
in secret to Dhritarashtra: &#8220;When thine enemy is in thy
power, destroy him by whatever means is at thy disposal,
in secret or openly. Show him no mercy, nor give him
thy protection. If thy son, or brother, or kinsman, or
thy father even, should become thine enemy, do not
hesitate to slay if thou wouldst have prosperity. Let
him be overcome either by spells, or by curses, or by
deception, or by payment of money. Do not forget
thine enemy, even although thou mayst disdain him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The maharajah lent a willing ear thereafter to the
counsel of his son, whom, in his secret heart, he favoured
most.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>
<p>Ere the Pandavas had left Hastinapur, Duryodhana
sent unto Varanavartha his secret agent, Purochana, to
erect a commodious new dwelling for them. This was
accomplished with all speed, and it became known as the
&#8220;house of lac&#8221;. It was built of combustible material:
much hemp and resin were packed in the walls and
between the floors, and it was plastered over with mortar
well mixed with pitch and clarified butter.</p>

<p>Purochana welcomed the Pandavas when they arrived
at Varanavartha, and they wondered at the splendour
of the great new dwelling. But Yudhishthira smelt the
mortar, and he went over the whole house examining
it closely; then he said unto Bhima: &#8220;The enemy hath
caused this mansion to be erected for us, and their trusted
workers have done well for them, for it is full of hemp
and straw, resin and bamboo, and the mortar is mixed
with pitch and clarified butter.&#8221;</p>

<p>In due time a stranger visited the Pandavas, and he
repeated the secret verse which Vidura had communicated
to Yudhishthira. He said: &#8220;I will construct for
you a secret passage underground which will lead to a
place of safety, lest you should have to escape from this
house when the doors are made secure and it is set on
fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the man set to work in secret, and ere long the
underground passage was ready. Then Bhima resolved
to deal with Purochana in the very manner that he had
undertaken to deal with the princes.</p>

<p>One evening Pritha gave a feast in the new dwelling
to all the poor people in Varanavartha. When the guests
had taken their departure, there remained behind a poor
Bhil woman and her five sons, who had drunken heavily,
as was the custom of their people, and were unable to rise
up. They slumbered on the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>A great windstorm had arisen, and the night was
dark. So Bhima deemed that the time had come to
accomplish his purpose. He went outside and secured
the doors of the dwelling of Purochana, which stood
beside that of the Pandavas; then he set it on fire. Soon
the flames spread towards the new mansion which had
been erected according to Duryodhana's desire, and it
burned fiercely and speedily. Pritha and her sons made
swift escape by the underground passage and took refuge
in the jungle. In the morning the people discovered
among the embers of Purochana's house the blackened
remains of his body and the bodies of his servants. In
the ruins of the Pandavas' dwelling they found that a
woman and five men had perished, and they lamented,
believing that Pritha and her sons were dead. There
was great sorrow in Hastinapur when the tidings were
borne thither. All the people bewailed the fate of the
Pandavas. Bhishma and Vidura wept, and blind Dhritarashtra
was moved to tears also. But Duryodhana rejoiced
in secret, believing that his enemies had all been
destroyed.</p>

<p>The Pandavas, having escaped through the subterranean
passage, hastened southwards and entered the
forest, which abounded with reptiles and wild animals
and with ferocious man-eating Asuras and Rakshasas of
gigantic stature. Weary and footsore were they all, and
greatly oppressed with sleepiness and fear. At length
the mighty Bhima lifted up all the others and hastened
on through the darkness: he took his mother on his
back, and Madri's sons on his shoulders, and Yudhishthira
and Arjuna under his arms. He went swifter than the
wind, breaking down trees by his breast and furrowing
the ground that he stamped upon. The whole forest was
shaken as with fear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>At length the Pandavas, fatigued and athirst and
heavy with sleep, found a place to rest in safety; and
they all lay down to slumber below a great and beautiful
Banyan tree except mighty Bhima, who kept watch over
them.</p>

<p>Now there lived in the forest on a Shala tree a ferocious
Rakshasa named Hidimva. He was of grim visage
and terrible to behold; his eyes were red, and he was
red-haired and red-bearded; his cheeks were of cloud
colour and his mouth was large, with long, sharp-pointed
teeth, which gleamed in darkness; his ears were shaped
like to arrows; his neck was broad as a tree, his belly was
large, and his legs were of great length.</p>

<p>The monster was exceedingly hungry on that fateful
night. Scenting human flesh in the forest, he yawned
and scratched his grizzly beard, and spoke to his sister,
saying: &#8220;I smell excellent food, and my mouth waters;
to-night I will devour warm flesh and drink hot, frothy
blood. Hasten, now, and bring the sleeping men unto
me; we will eat them together, and afterwards dance
merrily in the wood.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the Rakshasa woman went towards the place
where the Pandavas slept. When she beheld Bhima, the
long-armed one, clad in royal garments and wearing his
jewels, she immediately fell in love with him, and she
said to herself: &#8220;This man with the shoulders of a lion
and eyes like to lotus blooms is worthy to be my husband.
I will not slay him for my evil brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now a Rakshasa woman has power to transform herself,
and this one at once assumed the shape of a beautiful
woman; her face became as fair as the full moon; on her
head was a garland of flowers, her hair hung in ringlets;
delicate was the hue of her skin, and she wore rich ornaments
of gold with many gems. Timidly she approached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
Bhima and spoke to him, saying: &#8220;O bull among men,
who art thou and whence comest thou? Who are these
fair ones lying in slumber there? Hear and know that
this forest is the abode of the wicked chieftain of the
Rakshasas. He is my brother, and hath sent me hither to
kill you all for food, but I desire to save thee, O long-armed
one. Be thou my husband. I will take thee to
a secret place among the mountains, for I can speed
through the air at will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Bhima: &#8220;I cannot leave my mother and my
brethren to become food for a Rakshasa.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman said: &#8220;Let me be thy servant. Awaken
thy mother and thy brethren and I will rescue you all
from my fierce brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Bhima: &#8220;I will not awaken them from pleasant
and needful slumber, because I do not fear a Rakshasa.
O fair one, thou canst go as it pleaseth thee, and I care
not if thou dost send thy brother unto me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meantime the Rakshasa chieftain had grown impatient.
He descended from his tree and hastened after
his sister, with gaping mouth and head thrown back.
Darkly blue was his body, like to a raincloud.</p>

<p>The Rakshasa woman said to Bhima: &#8220;He cometh
hither in wrath. Awaken thy kinsfolk, and I will carry
you all through the air to escape him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Bhima: &#8220;Look on my arms, which are strong
as the trunks of elephants; my legs are like iron maces,
and my chest is indeed powerful and broad. I will slay
this man-eater, thy brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Rakshasa chieftain heard the boast of Bhima,
and he fumed with rage when he beheld his sister in
comely human guise, and said to her: &#8220;I will slay thee
and those whom thou wouldst fain help against me.&#8221;
Then he rushed against her, but Bhima cried:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> &#8220;Thou
wilt not kill a woman while I am near. I challenge thee
to single combat now. This night will thy sister behold
thee slain by me as an elephant is slain by a lion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said the Rakshasa: &#8220;Boast not until thou art the
victor. I will kill thee first of all, then thy friends, and
last of all my treacherous sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having spoken thus, he rushed towards Bhima, who
nimbly seized the monster's outstretched arms and,
wrestling violently, cast him on the ground. Then as
a lion drags off his prey, Bhima dragged the struggling
Rakshasa into the depths of the forest, lest his yells
should awaken the sleepers. There they fought together
like furious bull elephants, tearing down branches and
overthrowing trees.</p>

<p>At length the dread clamour awoke the Pandavas,
and they gazed with wonder on the beautiful woman who
kept watch in Bhima's place.</p>

<p>Said Pritha: &#8220;O celestial being, who art thou? If
thou art the goddess of woods or an Apsara, tell me why
thou dost linger here?&#8221;</p>

<p>The fair demon said: &#8220;I am the sister of the chieftain
of the Rakshasas, and I was sent hither to slay you all;
but when I beheld thy mighty son the love god wounded
me, and I chose him for my husband. Then my brother
followed angrily, and thy son is fighting with him, and
they are filling the forest with their shouting.&#8221;</p>

<p>All the brethren rushed to Bhima's aid, and they
saw the two wrestlers struggling in a cloud of dust, and
they appeared like two high cliffs shrouded in mist.</p>

<p>Arjuna cried out: &#8220;O Bhima, I am here to help thee.
Let me slay the monster.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bhima answered: &#8220;Fear not, but look on. The
Rakshasa will not escape from my hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Arjuna:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> &#8220;Do not keep him alive too long. We
must hasten hence. The dawn is near, and Rakshasas
become stronger at daybreak; they exercise their powers
of deception during the two twilights. Do not play with
him, therefore, but kill him speedily.&#8221;</p>

<p>At these words Bhima became strong as Vayu, his sire,
when he is angered,<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> and, raising aloft the Rakshasa, he
whirled him round and round, crying: &#8220;In vain hast
thou gorged on unholy food. I will rid the forest of
thee. No longer wilt thou devour human beings.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, dashing the monster to the ground, Bhima
seized him by the hair and by the waist, laid him over
a knee, and broke his back. So was the Rakshasa
slain.</p>

<p>Day was breaking, and Pritha and her sons immediately
turned away to leave the forest. The Rakshasa
woman followed them, and Bhima cried to her: &#8220;Begone!
or I will send thee after thy brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yudhishthira: &#8220;It is unseemly to slay a woman.
Besides, she is the sister of that Rakshasa, and even
although she became angry, what harm can she do us?&#8221;</p>

<p>Kneeling at Pritha's feet, the demon wailed: &#8220;O illustrious
and blessed lady, thou knowest the sufferings
women endure when the love god wounds them. Have
pity upon me now, and command thy son to take me
for his bride. If he continues to scorn me, I will slay
myself. Let me be thy slave, and I will carry you all
wheresoever you desire and protect you from perils.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pritha heard her with compassion, and prevailed upon
Bhima to take her for his bride. So the two were married
by Yudhishthira; then the Rakshasa took Bhima upon her
back and sped through the air to a lonely place among
the mountains which is sacred to the gods. They lived
together beside silvery streams and lakes sparkling with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>lotus blooms; they wandered through woods of blossoming
trees where birds sang sweetly, and by celestial sea-beaches
covered with pearls and nuggets of gold. The
demon bride had assumed celestial beauty, and ofttimes
played sweet music, and she made Bhima happy.</p>

<p>In time the woman became the mother of a mighty
son; his eyes were fiercely bright, like arrows were his
ears, and his mouth was large; he had copper-brown lips
and long, sharp teeth. He grew to be a youth an hour
after he was born, but, still remaining bald, his mother
named him Ghatotkacha, which signifies &#8220;pot-headed&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>Bhima then returned to his mother and his brethren
with his demon bride and her son. They abode together
for a time in the forest; then the Rakshasa bade all the
Pandavas farewell and departed with Ghatotkacha, who
promised to come to aid the Pandavas whenever they
called upon him.</p>

<p>One day thereafter Vyasa appeared before the Pandavas
and counselled them to go towards the city of
Eka-chakra<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> and to live there for a time in the house
of a Brahman. Then he vanished from sight, promising
to come again.</p>

<p>The Pandavas went therefore to Eka-chakra and lived
with a Brahman who had a wife and a daughter and an
infant son. Disguised as holy men, the brethren begged
for food as alms. Every evening they brought home
what they had obtained, and Pritha divided the whole
into two portions; the one half she gave to wolf-bellied
Bhima, and the rest she kept for his brethren and herself.</p>

<p>Now the city of Eka-chakra was protected against
every enemy by a forest-dwelling Rakshasa named Vaka,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>who was king of the Asuras.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> Each day the people had
to supply him with food, which consisted of a cartload of
rice, two bullocks, and the man who conveyed the meal
to him.</p>

<p>One morning a great wailing broke forth in the
Brahman's house because that the holy man was required
to supply the demon's feast. He was too poor to purchase
a slave, and he said he would deliver himself unto
Vaka. &#8220;Although I reach Heaven,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;I will
have no joy, for my family will perish when I am gone.&#8221;
His wife and his daughter pleaded in turn to take his
place, and the three wept together. Then the little boy
of tender years plucked a long spear of grass, and with
glowing eyes he spoke sweetly and said: &#8220;Do not weep,
Father; do not weep, Mother; do not weep, Sister.
With this spear I will slay the demon who devours
human beings.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they wept there they heard him, nor could forbear
smiling.</p>

<p>Pritha was deeply moved by the lamentations of the
Brahman family, and she said: &#8220;Sorrow not. I will send
forth my son Bhima to slay the Asura king.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Brahman made answer, saying: &#8220;That cannot be.
Thy sons are Brahmans and are under my protection. If
I go forth, I will but obey the rajah; if I send thy son, I
will be sin-guilty of his death, for the gods abhor the
man who causeth a guest to be slain, or permits a Brahman
to perish.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Pritha:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> &#8220;Bhima is strong and mighty, nor can a
demon do him any harm. He will slay this bloodthirsty
Rakshasa and return again in safety. But, O Brahman,
thou must not reveal unto anyone who hath performed
this mighty deed, lest the people should trouble my son
and desire to obtain the secret of his power, for he is
skilled in mantras.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>Then was the household made happy, and Bhima prepared
to go forth. That mighty hero collected the rice
and drove the bullocks towards the forest. When he
drew nigh to the appointed place, he began to eat the
food himself, and called the Rakshasa by name over and
over again. Vaka heard and came through the trees
towards Bhima. Red were his eyes, and his hair and
his beard were red also; his ears were pointed like
arrows; he had a mouth like a cave, and his forehead
was puckered in three lines. Terrible was he to look
upon; his body was huge, indeed.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>The Rakshasa saw Bhima eating his meal, and approached
angrily, biting his lower lip. &#8220;Fool,&#8221; he
cried, &#8220;wouldst thou devour my food before my very
eyes?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bhima smiled, and continued eating with face averted.
The demon smote him, but the hero only glanced round
as if one had touched his shoulder, and he went on eating
as before.</p>

<p>Raging furiously, the Rakshasa tore up a tree, and
Bhima rose leisurely and waited until it was flung at him.
When that was done, he caught the trunk nimbly and
hurled it back. Many trees were uprooted and flung
by one at the other. Then Vaka sprung forward to
wrestle, but the Pandava overthrew him and dragged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>him round and round until the demon gasped with
fatigue. The earth shook; trees were splintered in
pieces. Then Bhima began to strike the monster with
his iron fists, and at length he broke Vaka's back across
his knee. Terrible were the loud screams of the Rakshasa
while Bhima was bending him double. He died
howling.</p>

<p>A mighty clamour was then awakened in the forest.
All the other Asuras were terror-stricken, and, bellowing
horribly, they hastened towards Bhima and made obeisance
before him. Then Bhima made them take vows
never again to eat human flesh or to oppress the people
of the city. They promised willing obedience, and he
allowed them to depart.</p>

<p>Thereafter Pritha's son dragged the monster's body
to the main gate of Eka-chakra. He entered the city
secretly and hastened to the Brahman's house, and he told
Yudhishthira all that had taken place.</p>

<p>When the people of the city discovered that the Asura
king had been slain, they rejoiced greatly, and hastened
towards the house of the Brahman. But that holy man
made evasive answer to them, and said that his deliverer
was a certain high-souled Brahman who had offered to
supply food to the demon. Thereafter the people established
a festival in honour of Brahmans.</p>

<p>The Pandavas remained a time in the city, and they
studied the Vedas. One day there came to their dwelling
a saintly man of rigid vows, and he told the story of the
miraculous births of Drupada's son and daughter from
sacrificial fire.</p>

<p>When Drupada had lost half of his kingdom, he paid
pilgrimages to holy places. He promised great rewards
to superior Brahmans, so that he might have offspring,
ever desiring greatly to be avenged upon Drona. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
offered the austere Upayája a million cows if he would
procure a son for him, and that sage sent him unto his
brother Yája. Now Yája was reluctant to aid the rajah
thus; but at length he consented to perform the sacrificial
rite, and prevailed upon Upayája to help him.</p>

<p>So the rite was performed, and when the vital moment
came, the Brahmans called for the queen to partake in it.
But Drupada's wife was not prepared, and said: &#8220;My
mouth is still filled with saffron and my body is scented.
I am not fit to receive the libation which will bring offspring.
Tarry a little time for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the Brahmans could not delay the consummation
of the sacrificial rite. Ere the queen came, a son sprang
forth from the flames: he was clad in full armour, and
carried a falchion and bow, and a diadem gleamed brightly
upon his head. A voice out of the heavens said: &#8220;<i>This
prince hath come to destroy Drona and to increase the fame of
the Panchalas</i>&#8221;.</p>

<p>Next arose from the ashes on the altar a daughter of
great beauty. She was exceedingly dark, with long curling
locks and lotus eyes, and she was deep-bosomed
and slender-waisted. A sweet odour clung to her
body.</p>

<p>A voice out of heaven said: &#8220;<i>This dusky girl will
become the chief of all women. Many Kshatriyas must die
because of her, and the Kauravas will suffer from her. She
will accomplish the decrees of the gods.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the son was called Dhrishta-dyumna<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> and
the daughter Draupadi.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> Drona thereafter took the
Panchala prince to his palace, and instructed him to
become an accomplished warrior. He knew that he
could not thwart destiny, and he desired to perpetuate
his own mighty deeds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>Having heard these words, Pritha desired to journey
towards Panchala, and she and her sons took leave of
their host. Ere they went away, the high-souled ascetic
said that Draupadi had been destined to become a Pandava
queen.</p>

<p>Pritha and her sons wandered from the banks of the
Ganges and went northwards, and soon they fell in with
great numbers of people all going the same way. Yudhishthira
spake to a troop of Brahmans, and asked them
whither they were bound, and they answered saying that
Drupada of Panchala was observing a great festival, and
that all the princes of the land were hastening to the
swayamvara of his peerless and slender-waisted daughter,
the beautiful Draupadi.</p>

<p>In that great and increasing company were Brahmans
who were to perform the sacred rites, and youths who
were to take part in joyous revelry&mdash;dancers and jugglers,
boxers and wrestlers, and those who displayed feats of
strength and skill at arms; there were also bards there
and singers to chant the praises of heroes.</p>

<p>The Brahmans praised the beauty of Draupadi, and
said to the Pandava brethren: &#8220;Come with us to the
festival and the sports and the swayamvara; you will
be feasted and will receive gifts. You are all as comely
as princes and as fair as the bright gods; mayhap Draupadi
may choose from among ye this stalwart and noble
youth, strongly armed and of fearless bearing, and if he
should perform mighty feats, the garland may be thrown
upon his shoulders.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yudhishthira: &#8220;So be it. We will hasten
with you to the swayamvara and share banquet and
bounty.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the Pandavas went towards Panchala with the
troop of Brahmans. When they reached the city they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
took up their abode in the humble dwelling of a potter,
still disguised as Brahmans, and they went out and
begged food from the people.</p>

<p>In their secret hearts the brethren desired greatly to
win the fair bride whose fame had been bruited abroad.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII_The_Choice_of_Draupadi" id="CHAPTER_XIII_The_Choice_of_Draupadi">CHAPTER XIII<br />The Choice of Draupadi</a></h2>

<p class="blockcontents">Drupada's Hope&mdash;Conditions for winning his Daughter&mdash;The Great
Bow and Whirling Target&mdash;The Swayamvara&mdash;Pandavas in Disguise&mdash;Love-sick
Rajahs put to Shame&mdash;Karna strings the Bow&mdash;Rejected as a Base-born

<p>Now Drupada had long cherished the hope that Arjuna
would become his daughter's husband. He never revealed
his wish to any man, but ere he proclaimed the
swayamvara of Draupadi, he thought of the great Pandava
archer, and caused to be made a powerful bow
which only a strong man could bend and string. For
a target he had constructed a strange and curious device:
a high pole was erected, and it was surmounted by a
golden fish, which was poised above a swiftly-revolving
wheel. Then Drupada issued a proclamation far and
wide summoning the regents and princes of the world
to the swayamvara. He said: &#8220;The man who will bend
the bow and shoot an arrow through the wheel which
will strike and bring down the golden fish shall obtain
my daughter in marriage.&#8221; None but a mighty archer
who was Arjuna's equal could hope to win the beautiful
Draupadi, for five arrows only were allowed to each competitor,
and the fish must needs be struck on an eye to
be brought down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>A great field was enclosed for the swayamvara. It
was surrounded by a fosse and barrier and swan-white
pavilions, with domes and turrets that were agleam with
gold and jewels, festoons and streamers and bright garlands.
The turrets of the royal mansion were lofty and
golden like Himalayan mountain peaks.</p>

<p>For sixteen days there were sports and banquets, and
everyone within the city made merry. Then came the
great and festal day. At dawn trumpets and drums
awakened the people, and flags and flowers decorated
every street. The whole populace gathered on the plain
and massed around the barriers. The rajah's soldiers
kept order, and wrestlers and jugglers and dancers and
musicians performed merrily until the appointed hour
drew nigh.</p>

<p>At length the people roared their welcome to the
king and the high-born ladies and all the royal guests,
who thronged the galleries and pavilions. The mighty
rajahs, frowning defiance one upon another, were ranged
on lofty seats round the throne of King Drupada. Multitudes
had gathered to gaze on the glittering scene, pressing
against the barriers, or clustering on trees and scaffolds,
while others looked down from lofty lattice and high
house roofs.... A thousand trumpets clamoured; and
the murmuring of the swaying people was like the voice
of the heaving main.</p>

<p>Among others came in all her beauty the Princess
Draupadi, stepping gently and sweet, bearing in a delicate
hand the golden bridal garland, which was adorned with
sparkling gems. Tardily she made approach, blushing
with increasing loveliness, and appeared in the presence
of the princes. Mighty and high-born men were there.
The Pandavas beheld in the galleries their enemies
Duryodhana, Karna, and all the great Kauravas, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
saw also Krishna, the amorous and powerful one, and
his brother, the wine-drinking Balarama<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>, the Yádava
princes, the Rajah of Sindhu and his sons, the Rajah of
Chedi, the Rajah of Kosala, the Rajah of Madra, and
many more. Now the Pandavas were still disguised as
Brahmans, and stood among the holy men.</p>

<p>An aged and white-haired Brahman, clad in white,
approached the high altar, chanting mantras. He spread
the holy grass and poured out oil; then he kindled
the sacred fire, and the offering to the gods was
blessed.</p>

<p>Thereafter the thousand trumpets were sounded,
and a tense silence fell upon the buzzing crowd. In
the solemn hush all eyes were turned towards the royal
mansion as Drupada's valiant son, Dhrishta-dyumna, led
forth his sister Draupadi, and in a voice like thunder
proclaimed his father's will, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here stands the noble princess, my sister. Whosoever
can bend this bow, and strike with an arrow yonder
whirling target set on high, may, if his lineage is
noble, claim Draupadi for his bride. My words are
truth!&#8221;</p>

<p>Having spoken thus, the prince recited to his sister
the names of the royal guests, their lineage and their
deeds of fame, and bade her award the golden garland
to the successful archer.</p>

<p>The rajahs then descended from their gorgeous
thrones and gathered around Draupadi as the bright gods
gather around Párvati, the mountain bride of Shiva. Their
hearts were filled with love for the maiden and with hate
for one another. Rivals frowned upon rivals. Those
who had been close friends became of a sudden angry
enemies because that Draupadi was so beautiful. Krishna
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>and Balarama alone remained aloof; calmly and self-restrained
they stood apart, while rajah opposed rajah
like to angry elephants.</p>

<p>Each of the love-sick monarchs gazed upon the
mighty bow and upon the whirling target on high, and
for a time no man sought to lift the bow lest he should
be unable to bend it and then be put to shame. At
length a rajah, more bold than the others, picked it up
and tried his strength without avail; another followed
and another, but failed to string it. Soon many rajahs
strained their arms in vain, and some fell upon the
ground and groaned, while the laughter of the people
pealed around the barriers.... The gods had assembled
in mid-air and looked down with steadfast eyes.</p>

<p>At length proud Karna strode forward; he took the
bow and bent it and fixed the bowstring. Then he
seized an arrow. Drupada and his son were alarmed,
fearing he might succeed and claim the bride. Suddenly
Draupadi intervened, for she would not have the son of
a charioteer for her lord. She said, speaking loudly: &#8220;I
am a king's daughter, and will not wed with the base-born....&#8221;</p>

<p>Karna smiled bitterly, his face aflame. He cast down
the bow and walked away, gazing towards the sun. He
said: &#8220;O sun! be my witness that I cast aside the bow,
not because I am unable to hit the mark, but because
Draupadi scorns me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Others sought to perform the feat, but in vain, and
many rajahs feared to make attempt lest they should
compel the laughter of the people. A buzz of merry
voices arose from beyond the barriers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Pandava brethren, disguised as Brahmans,
looked on with the others.</p>

<p>Then suddenly silence fell upon everyone, for Arjuna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
advanced from the priestly band to lift the bow. The
Brahmans applauded him, shaking their deerskins.</p>

<p>Said the rajahs: &#8220;Can a weakly Brahman, who is a
mere stripling, accomplish a feat which is beyond the
strength of mighty warriors.&#8221;</p>

<p>Others said: &#8220;The Brahman knoweth best his own
skill. He would not go forward if he were not confident
of success.&#8221;</p>

<p>An aged priest endeavoured to restrain Arjuna, lest
he should by his failure bring ridicule upon the Brahmans;
but the hero would not be thwarted. He strode
forward like to a stately elephant and bared his broad
shoulders and ample chest. He was nimble as a lion,
and calm and self-possessed.</p>

<p>Ere he lifted the bow, he walked round it; then he
addressed a prayer to the gods.... He stood up unmoved
and serene as a mountain peak, and he bent the
bow and fixed an arrow in it....</p>

<p>All eyes watched him. He drew the cord, and the
arrow flew upwards with a hissing sound; it hit the
target eye, and the golden fish fell over and clashed
upon the ground.</p>

<p>Like distant thunder arose the plaudits of the multitude;
hundreds of Brahmans shouted in ecstasy and
waved their scarfs; a thousand trumpets clamoured in
triumph, and the drums were beaten loud....</p>

<p>The heart of Draupadi was filled with joy, and,
smiling coyly, she advanced towards Arjuna and flung
the golden bridal garland over his shoulders. Celestial
blossoms fluttered, descending through the air, and the
sound of celestial music was heard.</p>

<p>Drupada was well pleased, because he had already recognized
the hero in his Brahman guise; but the jealous
rajahs stormed in fury, and each said unto the other:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
&#8220;Behold! the king goeth to greet this youth. To him
we are as worthless as jungle grass; he tramples upon us
in his pride.... Are we to be humbled by a Brahman
and denied the fruit of our nourished hopes? The
daughter of a rajah must even choose a Kshatriya for
her husband.... Verily, the life of a priest is sacred,
but the rajah who scorns his peers must die&mdash;he and
his son together. Let us seize also this shameless
woman who honours the Brahman&mdash;that trespasser of
our birthright&mdash;so that she may be burned at the
stake!&#8221;</p>

<p>Shouting with anger one to another, the rajahs poured
from the galleries with drawn swords and rushed towards
Arjuna and the princess. Like ponderous wild elephants
they advanced; but the Pandavas rose against them.
Arjuna bent the great bow, and Bhima, having no weapon,
uprooted a tree and stood defying them like to hell's
stern judge wielding his mighty club. Yudhishthira and
the younger brothers were soon beside them, and the
Brahmans hastened also to give their aid.</p>

<p>For a moment the rajahs paused, wondering at the
daring of the priestly band; but impatient Karna and
angry Salya, Rajah of Madra, dashed forward like to
infuriated elephants against Arjuna and Bhima. The
brothers sustained the shock, and when Karna had been
struck by Arjuna, he faltered in amaze and said: &#8220;Brahman,
who art thou? Art thou a god in human guise?
No Brahman could thus attack me, nor dost there live
a man who can thwart me with defiance as thou hast
done even now, save Arjuna alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Arjuna,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span> &#8220;I am nor god nor hero, but a humble
Brahman who hath been trained to use of arms. I have
come hither to tame thy pride, thou haughty youth;
therefore be firm.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Karna fell back, deeming it vain to oppose the
power of a holy man.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Madra's king fought against peerless
Bhima. Both were long-armed and of gigantic strength.
Sharp and fierce was their conflict. When their clubs were
splintered, they leapt one upon the other and wrestled
fiercely, struggling with all their might. Then, of a
sudden, Bhima stopped and swung aloft the mighty rajah
and threw him heavily upon the ground, where he lay
unconscious and bleeding before the eyes of the multitude.</p>

<p>The rajahs drew back, humbled because of Karna's
flight and Salya's downfall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brave, indeed, are the Brahmans,&#8221; they said. &#8220;Who
can they be? What is their lineage? and whence come
they?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Pandavas scorned to make answer. But Krishna
had knowledge of who they were, and he interposed with
gentle words to soothe the angry rajahs. The monarchs
heard him and withdrew, and the tumult was appeased.</p>

<p>Then Arjuna took Draupadi by the hand and led
her away in peace from that scene of angry strife. So
ended the swayamvara, and Krishna declared that the
bride had been fairly won.</p>

<p>The Pandava brethren went towards the house of
the potter, and they entered and addressed their mother
Pritha, saying: &#8220;A great gift have we obtained this day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Pritha: &#8220;Then share the gift between you, as
becomes brethren.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yudhishthira said: &#8220;What hast thou said, O mother?
The gift is the Princess Draupadi whom Arjuna hath won
at the swayamvara.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Pritha:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span> &#8220;Alas! what have I said? I have sinned
deeply in saying, &#8216;Then share the gift between you, as
becomes brethren.&#8217; But, O Yudhishthira, my son, the
fatal words have been spoken; you must devise how
they can be obeyed without involving one another in
wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yudhishthira pondered a time and then spake to
Arjuna, saying: &#8220;My brother, thou hast won Draupadi
by thine own merit. She must therefore be thy bride.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Arjuna: &#8220;Thou, Yudhishthira, art our elder
brother and we are thy servants. The princess is for
thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yudhishthira said: &#8220;Let this matter be arranged in
accordance with the will of the gods. It is for Drupada
to say unto which of us his daughter will be given.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, as hath already been told, each one of the
Pandavas yearned in his secret heart to have Draupadi
for his bride....</p>

<p>Meanwhile the evening meal had been prepared, and
Pritha desired that the princess should at once take her
place, and serve out the portions to the brethren. So
she said unto Draupadi: &#8220;Divide the food, and first set
aside a share for the poor; then cut what is left into two
parts, one part for Bhima, and the rest for my other sons
and for thee and me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The princess smiled when she beheld the great meal
which Bhima devoured.</p>

<p>When they had all eaten they retired to rest. Draupadi
slept with Pritha, and the brethren lay at their feet.</p>

<p>King Drupada was sore troubled in heart after his
daughter had been led away to the potter's house, and
he sent his valiant son to watch her. Dhrishta-dyumna
went forth in disguise, and, listening at the window, he
discovered to his joy that the Brahmans were no other
than the Pandava brethren. He returned to his royal
sire and related all that had happened, and what had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
spoken at the evening meal. The king was well pleased
because that the brethren were Kshatriyas and not
Brahmans.</p>

<p>In the morning Drupada sent a priest to the potter's
house to ask how it fared with all the brethren.</p>

<p>Said Yudhishthira: &#8220;Inform thou the rajah that his
daughter hath been won by a family who will not bring
shame or disgrace upon his royal name. None but a
man of high birth could have shot down the fish of
gold.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drupada, ere this message was delivered unto him,
sent a second messenger bidding the brethren to come
to the palace because that the nuptial feast was ready....
Two chariots awaited them. Then Pritha and
Draupadi entered one of the chariots together, and the
five brethren entered the other, and they were all driven
towards the royal palace.</p>

<p>When the people beheld the Pandavas and marked
their comely bearing and royal gait, they knew that they
were not Brahmans, but high-born Kshatriyas.</p>

<p>The Pandava guests were made welcome, and the
king and his son and all his counsellors sat down to feast
with them.</p>

<p>Said the rajah at length unto Yudhishthira: &#8220;I perceive
that you are men of high birth. Tell me, therefore,
I pray thee, who ye are&mdash;your names and your
lineage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yudhishthira said: &#8220;We are of humble birth. Do
now with us as is thy desire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Drupada: &#8220;In Indra's name, I adjure thee to
reveal yourselves unto me now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yudhishthira said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> &#8220;Know, then, that we are the
Pandava princes.... Our brother Arjuna was the
winner of Draupadi. Thy daughter, like to a lotus,
hath been but transferred from one lake to another. I
have spoken what is true.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drupada glowed with joy and satisfaction. He prevailed
upon the brethren to remain at the palace, and
entertained them for many days.</p>

<p>At length Yudhishthira was addressed by Drupada,
who said: &#8220;Thou art the elder brother. Speak and say
if it is thy desire that Arjuna be given Draupadi for his
bride.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yudhishthira: &#8220;I would fain speak with Vyasa,
the great Rishi, regarding this matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now Vyasa was in the city of Panchala at that time,
and he was brought before the rajah, who spake to him
regarding Draupadi.</p>

<p>The Rishi said: &#8220;The gods have already declared
that she will become the wife of all the five Pandava
brethren.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drupada's son spoke and said: &#8220;With reverence I
have heard thy words, O Vyasa, but to me it appears
that Draupadi hath been betrothed unto Arjuna alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yudhishthira: &#8220;Thou hast spoken truly, but
there is wisdom in the words of Vyasa which in my heart
I cannot condemn. Besides, our mother hath already
commanded us to share our gift together.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Vyasa told that Draupadi was the reincarnation
of a pious woman who once prayed unto the god Shiva
for a husband: five times she prayed, and the god
rewarded her with the promise of five husbands in her
next existence. Vyasa also revealed that the Pandava
brethren were five incarnations of Indra, and thus were
but as one.</p>

<p>Drupada then gave consent for his daughter to become
the bride of all the brethren, and it was arranged
that she should be married unto them all, one after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
other, according to their ages. So on five successive
days she was led round the holy fire by each of the five
Pandava princes.</p>

<p>Drupada thereafter conferred great gifts upon his
sons-in-law; he gave them much gold and many jewels,
and he gave them numerous horses and chariots and
elephants, and also a hundred female servants clad in
many-coloured robes, and adorned with gems and bright
garlands. Unto the Pandavas Krishna gave much
raiment and ornaments of gold, and rare vessels sparkling
with jewels, besides female servants from various
kingdoms.</p>

<p>Now when Duryodhana came to know that the
Pandava brethren were still alive, and had formed a
powerful alliance with Drupada, he was moved to jealous
wrath. A great council was held, at which the young
men clamoured for war and the grave elders spoke in
favour of peace. At length it was agreed that the Pandava
princes should be invited to return to Hastinapur
so that the raj might be divided between them and the
sons of Dhritarashtra. Then Vidura was sent to Panchala
to speak with the Rajah Drupada and his sons-in-law
regarding this matter.</p>

<p>The Pandava brethren returned to Hastinapur with
Vidura. They took with them their mother, Queen
Pritha, and their wife, Draupadi, and the people went
forth in great multitudes and bade them glad welcome.
Then there was much rejoicing and many banquets.</p>

<p>At length Dhritarashtra spake unto Yudhishthira and
his brethren and said: &#8220;I will now divide the raj between
you and my sons. Your share will be the southwestern
country of Khandava-prastha.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Bhishma: &#8220;The maharajah hath spoken wisely.
It is meet that you should depart unto the country of
Khandava-prastha as he hath decreed.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the Pandava princes bade farewell to all their
kinsmen and to wise Drona, and they went towards their
own country. On the banks of the Jumna they built a
strong fort, and in time they made a great clearance in
the forest. When they had gathered together the people
who were subject unto them, they erected a great and
wonderful city like unto the city of Indra, and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
called Indra-prastha.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> High walls, which resembled the
Mandara mountains, were built round about, and these
were surrounded by a deep moat wide as the sea.</p>

<p>In time the fame of Rajah Yudhishthira went far and
wide. He ruled with wisdom and with power, and he
had great piety. Forest robbers were pursued constantly
and put to death, and wrongdoers were ever brought to
justice; indeed, the people who suffered from evildoing
went before the rajah as children go before a father seeking
redress.</p>

<p>The brethren lived happily together. In accordance
with the advice of a Rishi, they made a compact that
when one of them was sitting beside Draupadi, none of
the others should enter, and that if one of them should
be guilty of intrusion, he must needs go into exile for the
space of twelve years.</p>

<p>As it chanced, Yudhishthira was sitting with Draupadi
one day when a Brahman, whose cattle had been carried
off, hastened to Arjuna and entreated him to pursue the
band of robbers. The weapons of the prince were in the
king's palace, and to obtain them Arjuna entered the
room in which Yudhishthira and Draupadi sat, thus breaking
the compact made by the brethren. He hastened
after the robbers and recovered the stolen cattle, which he
brought back unto the Brahman.</p>

<p>On his return to the palace, Arjuna said unto his
brother that he must needs become an exile for twelve
years to expiate his offence. Yudhishthira, however,
sought to prevail upon him not to depart. But Arjuna
made answer that he had pledged his oath to fulfil the
terms of the compact. &#8220;I cannot waver from truth,&#8221; he
said; &#8220;truth is my weapon.&#8221; So when he had bidden
farewell to Pritha and Draupadi and his four brethren,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>he took his departure from the city of Indra-prastha.
And a band of Brahmans went with him.</p>

<p>Arjuna wandered through the jungle, and he visited
many holy places. One day he went unto Hurdwar,
where the Ganges flows upon the plain, and he bathed
in the holy waters. There he met with Ulúpí, daughter
of Vásuka, king of the Nagas, who had great beauty.
She loved him, and she led him to her father's palace,
where he abode a time, and she gave him the power to
render himself invisible in water. A child was born unto
them, and he was named Iravat.</p>

<p>Thereafterwards Arjuna went southwards until he
came to the Mahendra mountain.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> He was received
there by Parasu Rama, the Brahman hero, who gave him
gifts of powerful weapons, and imparted to him the secret
of using them.</p>

<p>So he wandered from holy place to holy place until
he reached Manipur. Now the rajah of that place had
a beautiful daughter whose name was Chitrángadá.
Arjuna loved her, and sought her for his bride. The
rajah said: &#8220;I have no other child, and if I give her
unto thee, her son must remain here to become my
heir, for the god Shiva hath decreed that the rajahs of
this realm can have each but one child.&#8221; Arjuna married
the maiden, and he dwelt for three years at Manipur. A
son was born, and he was named Chitrangada. Thereafter
Arjuna set out on his wanderings once more.</p>

<p>He passed through many strange lands, travelling
westward, and at length he reached the city of Prabhása<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>,
which is nigh to Dwáraká, on the southern sea, the
capital of his kinsman Krishna, rajah of the Yádhavas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>Krishna welcomed Arjuna, and took the Pandava hero
to dwell in his palace. Then he gave a great feast on
the holy mountain of Raivataka, which lasted for two
days. Arjuna looked with love upon Krishna's fair
sister, Subhadra<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>, a girl of sweet smiles, and desired her
for a bride.</p>

<p>Now it was the wish of Balarama that Subhadra should
be given unto Duryodhana, whom, indeed, she would
have chosen had a swayamvara been held. So Krishna
advised Arjuna to carry her away by force, in accordance
with the advice of the sages, who had said aforetime:
&#8220;Men applaud the Kshatriyas who win brides by abducting
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the feast was over, Arjuna drove his chariot
from the holy mountain towards Dwaraka until he came
nigh to Subhadra. Nimbly he leapt down and took her
by the hand and lifted her into his chariot; then he drove
hastily towards the city of Indra-prastha.</p>

<p>Balarama was greatly angered, and desired to pursue
Arjuna; and he spoke to Krishna, saying: &#8220;Thou art
calm, and I can perceive that Arjuna has done this thing
with thy knowledge. Thou shouldst not have given our
sister unto him without my consent. But let the deed
be upon his own head, for I will pursue him and slay
him and his brethren, one and all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Krishna: &#8220;Arjuna is our kinsman<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> and of noble
birth, and is a worthy husband for Subhadra. If thou
wilt pursue him and bring back our sister, no one else
will marry her now because that she hath been in the
house of another. Better were it that we should send
messengers after Arjuna and invite him to return here,
so that the marriage may be held according to our rites.&#8221;</p>

<p>Balarama said: &#8220;So be it, seeing that thou art well
pleased with this matter.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that messengers followed Arjuna
and prevailed upon him to return with Subhadra to
Dwaraka. A great feast was then held, and they were
married with pomp and in state. And Arjuna abode at
the court of Krishna for many months, until the time of
his exile came to an end.</p>

<p>When Arjuna returned to Indra-prastha with Subhadra,
he was received with great rejoicing by his brethren.
He went unto Draupadi and greeted her; but she said
coldly: &#8220;Why come hither? Where is the sister of
Krishna?&#8221;</p>

<p>Arjuna soothed her with gentle words; and then
Subhadra approached Draupadi, attired in red silk, but
in the simple fashion of a keeper of cows, and made
obeisance before her, saying: &#8220;I am thy handmaiden.&#8221;</p>

<p>Draupadi embraced the sister of Krishna and said
&#8220;Let thy husband be without an enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The heart of Subhadra was filled with joy at these
words; she said: &#8220;So be it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus was peace made; the two women thereafter
loved one another, and to Pritha both were very dear.</p>

<p>Now Draupadi became the mother of five sons to her
five husbands; and Subhadra had one son only, and his
name was Abhimanyu<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>, who in the years that followed
was an illustrious warrior.</p>

<p>As time went on, the Pandavas grew more and more
powerful. They waged great wars, until many rajahs
owed them allegiance; and at length Yudhishthira
deemed that the time had come to hold his great Rajasúya
sacrifice to celebrate the supremacy of his power over
all.</p>

<p>Krishna came to Indra-prastha at this time and said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
&#8220;There is now but one rajah who must needs be overcome
ere the Imperial sacrifice can be performed: his name
is Jarasandha, monarch of Magadha. He hath already
conquered six-and-eighty kings, and he hath slaughtered
those who were our kinsmen dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now this rajah was of great valour and matchless
strength. His body was invulnerable against weapons;
not even the gods could wound him with mace or sword
or with arrow. He was also of miraculous birth, for he
was born of two mothers<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> who had eaten of a mantra-charmed
mango which fell into the lap of his sire when that
he was childless and was undergoing penances to obtain
offspring. Nor did the babe come to life after birth until
he was united by a Rakshasa woman, named Jara, the
goddess of the household, who, because she was worshipped
in the palace, performed some good each day in
return.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> So the child was called Jarasandha<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>, which signifies
&#8220;united by Jara&#8221;, and he increased daily like to the moon
in its first phase.</p>

<p>Krishna said unto Yudhishthira: &#8220;This monarch of
Magadha cannot be vanquished in battle even by gods
or by demons. But he may be overcome in a conflict,
fighting with bare arms. Now I am &#8216;Policy&#8217;, Bhima is
&#8216;Strength&#8217;, and Arjuna is &#8216;Protector&#8217;. Together, O king,
we will surely accomplish the death of Jarasandha, who is
arrogant and covetous and proud.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yudhishthira: &#8220;Do as it seemeth best unto thee,
O lord of the universe; thou art our wise counsellor and
guide.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Krishna, Arjuna, and Bhima disguised themselves
as Brahmans and went towards the city of Mathura,
which was Jarasandha's capital. When they arrived there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>they entered the palace of the mighty rajah like to mountain
lions eyeing cattle-folds. They went boldly before the
king decked with flowers, and the king said: &#8220;Ye are
welcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>Arjuna and Bhima were silent, but Krishna spake to
Jarasandha, saying: &#8220;These two men are observing vows,
and will not open their mouths until midnight; after that
hour they will speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>The king provided for his guests in the sacrificial
chamber, and after midnight he visited them, and discovering
that they were warriors, he asked: &#8220;Tell me
truly who ye are, and why ye have come hither.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Krishna: &#8220;We are decked with flowers to achieve
prosperity, and we have entered the abode of our enemy
to fulfil the vows of Kshatriyas.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jarasandha said: &#8220;I have never done you an injury.
Why, therefore, do ye regard me as your enemy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Krishna revealed himself, and upbraided the
king because that he was wont to offer up in sacrifice to
Shiva the rajahs whom he took captive in battle. He
said: &#8220;Thou hast slaughtered our kinsmen in this manner
because thou dost imagine there liveth no man
who is so powerful as thou. For thy sins thou art
doomed to go to Yama's kingdom, there to be tortured
a time. But thou canst attain to the Heaven of Indra
by dying the death of a Kshatriya in battle with thy
peers. Now, O king, we challenge thee to combat. Set
free the rajahs who are in thy dungeons, or die at our
hands!&#8221;</p>

<p>Said the king:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span> &#8220;I have taken captive in battle these
royal prisoners of mine, whom I shall offer in sacrifice
to Shiva, according to my vow. Let us therefore
meet in battle, army against army, or in single
combat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Krishna said: &#8220;Meet thou one of us in single
combat. With whom dost thou desire to fight?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Jarasandha expressed his wish to meet Bhima
in battle. Bhima was made glad thereat, for, in truth,
he thirsted for the conflict; but he desired that they
should fight without weapons, and the king consented,
and made ready for the fray.</p>

<p>Now Jarasandha was of lofty stature and great
strength, and he fought so fiercely that the combat lasted
for thirteen days in presence of great multitudes of the
people. In the end the king was swung aloft, and his
back was broken over Bhima's knee. Then a mighty
tumult arose, which caused all who were there to quake
with fear, for the roar of the Pandavas mingled with the
shrieks of Jarasandha ere death silenced him.</p>

<p>Krishna went boldly into the palace and set free all
the rajahs who were in captivity. And one by one they
took vows to attend the Imperial sacrifice. Then Krishna
received Sahadeva, son of Jarasandha, and installed him
as Rajah of Magadha.</p>

<p>When the great Yudhishthira came to know that
Jarasandha had been slain, he sent forth his four brethren
with great armies to collect tribute from every rajah in
the world.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> Some there were among the kings who
welcomed them; others had to be conquered in battle.
But when they had sworn allegiance to Yudhishthira, they
joined the Pandava force and assisted in achieving further
victories. A whole year went past ere the brethren returned
again unto Indra-prastha.</p>

<p>Krishna came from Dwaraka to aid Yudhishthira at
the ceremony, and he brought with him much wealth and
a mighty army.</p>

<p>Stately pavilions were erected for the kings who came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>to attend the great sacrifice: their turrets were high, and
they were swan-white and flecked with radiant gold.
Silver and gold adorned the walls of the rooms, which
were richly perfumed and carpeted and furnished to befit
the royal guests.</p>

<p>Then the rajahs came to Indra-prastha in all their
splendour and greeted mighty Yudhishthira. Those who
were friends brought gifts, and those who had been
subdued in battle brought tribute. White-haired and
blind old Dhritarashtra came, and with him were Kripa
and Bhishma and Vidura. Proud Duryodhana and his
brethren came also, professing friendship, and Karna came
with bow and spear and mace. Drona and his son, and
their enemies Drupada and his son, were there also, and
Balarama, Krishna's brother, and their father Vasudeva.
And among many others were jealous Sishupala<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>, King
of Chedi<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>, and his son, and both wore bright golden
armour.</p>

<p>Many Brahmans assembled at Indra-prastha, and
Krishna honoured them and washed their feet. The
gifts that were given to these holy sages were beyond
computation. In great numbers came men of every
caste also; and all were feasted at banquets, so that the
words &#8220;Take ye and eat&#8221; were heard continuously on
every hand.</p>

<p>Now there were deep and smouldering jealousies
among the assembled rajahs, and when the time came
to honour him who was regarded as the greatest among
them by presenting the Arghya<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>, their passions were set
ablaze. First Bhishma spake forth and said that the
honour was due to Krishna, the pious one, who was the
noblest and greatest among them all. &#8220;Krishna,&#8221; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>said, &#8220;is the origin of all things; the universe came into
being for him alone. He is the incarnation of the
Creator, the everlasting one, who is beyond man's comprehension.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the Arghya was given unto Krishna, Sishupala,
the Rajah of Chedi, arose in wrath and said: &#8220;It
ill becomes thee, O Yudhishthira, to honour thus an
uncrowned chieftain. Gathered about thee are ruling
kings of highest fame. If the honour be due to age,
then Vasudeva can claim it before his son; if it is due
to the foremost rajah, then Drupada should be honoured;
if it is due to wisdom, Drona is the most worthy; if it is
due to holiness, Vyasa is the greatest. Drona's son hath
more knowledge than Krishna, Duryodhana is peerless
among younger men, Kripa is the worthiest priest, and
Karna the greatest archer. For what reason should homage
be paid unto Krishna, who is neither the holiest priest,
the wisest preceptor, the greatest warrior, nor the foremost
chieftain? To the shame of this assembly be it said
that it doth honour the murderer of his own rajah, this
cowherd of low birth.&#8221;</p>

<p>So spake Sishupala, the tiger-hearted one, and terrible
was his wrath. He hated Krishna, because that he had
carried away by force the beautiful Rukmini, who had
been betrothed unto himself, the mighty Rajah of Chedi.</p>

<p>Krishna then spoke. Calm was he of voice and
demeanour, but his eyes were bright. Unto the rajahs
he said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span> &#8220;Hear me, O ye princes and kings! The
evil-tongued Sishupala is descended from a daughter
of our race, and in my heart I have never sought to
work ill against a kinsman. But once, when I went
eastward, he sacked my sea-swept Dwaraka and laid low
its temple; once he broke faith with a rajah and cast him
into prison; once he seized the consort of a king by
force; and once he disguised himself as the husband of
a chaste princess and deceived her. And I have suffered
because of his sins, nor sought vengeance, because that
he was of our own race. He hath even come after my
consort Rukmini, and is worthy of death.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke, the faces of many rajahs grew red with
shame and anger, but Sishupala laughed aloud and made
answer: &#8220;I seek no mercy from Krishna, nor do I fear
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Krishna thought of his bright, resistless discus,
and immediately it was in his hand. In anger he spake
forth and said: &#8220;Hear me, ye lords of earth! I have
promised the pious mother of Sishupala to pardon a
hundred sins committed by her son. And I have fulfilled
my vow. But now the number is more than full,
and I will slay him, O ye mighty rajahs, before your eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having spoken thus, Krishna flung the discus, and
it struck Sishupala on the neck, so that his head was
severed from his body. He fell down like to a cliff struck
by the thunderbolt. Then the assembled rajahs beheld
a great wonder, for the passion-cleansed soul of Sishupala
issued from his body, beautiful as the sun in heaven,
and went towards Krishna. Its eyes were like to lotus
blooms, and its form like to a flame; and it adored
Krishna and entered into his body.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>The rajahs all looked on, silent and amazed, while
thunder bellowed out of heaven, and lightning flashed,
and rain poured down in torrents. Some grew angry,
and laid hands on their weapons to avenge the death
of Sishupala; others rejoiced that he had been slain;
the Brahmans chanted the praises of Krishna.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>
<p>Yudhishthira commanded his brothers to perform the
funeral rites over the dead with every honour. So the
body of Sishupala was burned and the oblation poured
forth. Then his son was proclaimed Rajah of Chedi.</p>

<p>Thereafter the great sacrifice was performed with
solemnity and in peace. Krishna, who had maintained
the supremacy of Yudhishthira by slaying a dangerous
and jealous rival, looked on benignly.</p>

<p>Holy water was sprinkled by the Brahmans, and all
the monarchs made obeisance and honoured Yudhishthira,
saying: &#8220;Thou hast extended the fame of thy mighty
sire, Pandu, and thou art become even greater than he
was. Thou hast graced with this sacrifice thine high station
and fulfilled all our hopes. Now, O emperor over all,
permit us to depart to our own homes, and bestow thy
blessing upon us.&#8221;</p>

<p>So one by one they took leave of Yudhishthira and
went away, and the four Pandavas accompanied the
greatest of them to the confines of their kingdoms.
Krishna was the last to bid farewell.</p>

<p>Said Yudhishthira: &#8220;Unto thee I owe all things.
Because thou wert here, O valorous one, I was able to
perform the great sacrifice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Krishna said: &#8220;Monarch of all! rule thou over
thy people with a father's wisdom and care. Be unto
them like rain which nourisheth the parched fields; be
a shade in hot sunshine; be a cloudless heaven bending
over all. Be thou ever free from pride and passion;
ever rule with power and justice and holiness, O
Yudhishthira.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he spake from his chariot and then went his way,
and Yudhishthira turned homeward with tear-dimmed
eyes.</p>

<p>Now when Duryodhana had witnessed the triumph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
of the Pandavas, his heart burned with jealous rage. He
envied the splendour of the palaces at Indra-prastha;
he envied the glory achieved by Yudhishthira. Well
he knew that he could not overcome the Pandavas in
open conflict, so he plotted with his brethren to accomplish
their fall by artifice and by wrong.</p>

<p>As in after-time the wise Sanjaya said: &#8220;The gods
first deprive of his reason that man unto whom they
ultimately send disgrace and defeat&#8221;.</p>

<p>But Duryodhana had to work the will of the Creator
under the influence of fate, and it was doomed that the
Pandavas should suffer for a time at his hands.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV_The_Great_Gambling_Match" id="CHAPTER_XV_The_Great_Gambling_Match">CHAPTER XV<br />The Great Gambling Match</a></h2>

<p class="blockcontents">Duryodhana's Plot&mdash;Shakuni the Gambler&mdash;Loaded Dice&mdash;Challenge to
Yudhishthira&mdash;An Unequal Contest&mdash;Pandavas lose Kingdom and become
Slaves&mdash;Draupadi Staked and Lost&mdash;How Duhsasana humbled her&mdash;Pandava

by Karna&mdash;Bhima's Terrible Vows&mdash;Alarming Omens&mdash;Pandavas regain
Liberty&mdash;Second Gambling Match&mdash;Pandavas go into Exile.</p>


<p>Now Shakuni, Prince of Gandhara,<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> and brother of Dhritarashtra's
queen, was renowned for his skill as a gambler.
He always enjoyed good fortune because that he played
with loaded dice. Duryodhana plotted with him, desiring
greatly to subjugate the Pandavas, and Shakuni said: &#8220;Be
advised by me. Yudhishthira loves the dice, although
he knows not how to play. Ask him to throw dice with
me, for there is no gambler who is my equal in the three
worlds. I will put him to shame. I will win from him
his kingdom, O bull among men.&#8221;</p>

<p>Duryodhana was well pleased at this proposal, and
he went before his blind father, the maharajah, and prevailed
upon him to invite the Pandavas to Hastinapur
for a friendly gambling match, despite the warnings of
the royal counsellors.</p>

<p>Said Dhritarashtra:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span> &#8220;If the gods are merciful, my
sons will cause no dispute. Let it be as fate hath ordained.
No evil can happen so long as I am near,
and Bhishma and Drona are near also. Therefore, let
the Pandavas be invited hither as my son desireth.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Vidura, who feared trouble, was sent unto Indra-prastha
to say: &#8220;The maharajah is about to hold a great
festival at Hastinapur, and he desires that Yudhishthira
and his brethren, their mother Pritha and their joint wife
Draupadi, should be present. A great gambling match
will be played.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Yudhishthira heard these words, he sorrowed
greatly, for well he knew that dice-throwing was ofttimes
the cause of bitter strife. Besides, he was unwilling to
play Prince Shakuni, that desperate and terrible gambler....
But he could not refuse the invitation of Dhritarashtra,
or, like a true Kshatriya, disdain a challenge
either to fight or to play with his peers.</p>

<p>So it came to pass that the Pandava brethren, with
Pritha, their mother, and their joint wife Draupadi, journeyed
to Hastinapur in all their splendour. Dhritarashtra
welcomed them in the presence of Bhishma and Drona
and Duryodhana and Karna; then they were received
by Queen Gandhari, and the wives of the Kaurava
princes; and all the daughters-in-law of the blind maharajah
became sad because that they were jealous of the
beauty of Draupadi and the splendour of her attire.</p>

<p>The Pandava lords and ladies went unto the dwelling
which had been prepared for them, and there they were
visited in turn by the lords and ladies of Hastinapur.</p>

<p>On the day that followed, Yudhishthira and his
brethren went together to the gambling match, which
was held in a gorgeous pavilion, roofed with arching
crystal and decorated with gold and lapis lazuli: it had
a hundred doors and a thousand great columns, and it
was richly carpeted. All the princes and great chieftains
and warriors of the kingdom were gathered there. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
Prince Shakuni of Gandhari was there also with his false
dice.</p>

<p>When salutations had passed, and the great company
were seated, Shakuni invited Yudhishthira to play.</p>

<p>Said Yudhishthira: &#8220;I will play if mine opponent will
promise to throw fairly, without trickery and deceit.
Deceitful gambling is sinful, and unworthy a Kshatriya;
there is no prowess in it. Wise men do not applaud
a player who winneth by foul means.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shakuni said: &#8220;A skilled gambler ever playeth with
purpose to vanquish his opponent, as one warrior fighteth
another less skilled than himself to accomplish his overthrow.
Such is the practise in all contests; a man plays
or fights to achieve victory.... But if thou art in dread
of me, O Yudhishthira, and afraid that thou wilt lose,
'twere better if thou didst not play at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yudhishthira: &#8220;Having been challenged, I cannot
withdraw. I fear not to fight or to play with any man....
But first say who doth challenge and who is to lay
stakes equally with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Duryodhana spoke, saying: &#8220;O rajah, I will
supply jewels and gold and any stakes thou wilt of
as great value as thou canst set down. It is for me
that Shakuni, my uncle, is to throw the dice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yudhishthira: &#8220;This is indeed a strange challenge.
One man is to throw the dice and another is to lay the
stakes. Such is contrary to all practice. If, however,
thou art determined to play in this fashion, let the game
begin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well did the Rajah of Indra-prastha know then that
the match would not be played fairly. But he sat down,
notwithstanding, to throw dice with Shakuni.</p>

<p>At the first throw Yudhishthira lost; indeed, he lost
at every throw on that fatal day. He gambled away all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
his money and all his jewels, his jewelled chariot with
golden bells, and all his cattle; still he played on, and he
lost his thousand war elephants, his slaves and beautiful
slave girls, and the remainder of his goods; and next, he
staked and lost the whole kingdom of the Pandavas, save
the lands which he had gifted to the Brahmans. Nor
did he cease to play then, despite the advice offered
him by the chieftains who were there. One by one he
staked and lost his brethren; and he staked himself and
lost also.</p>

<p>Said Shakuni: &#8220;You have done ill, Yudhishthira, in
staking thine own self, for now thou hast become a slave;
but if thou wilt stake Draupadi now and win, all that
thou hast lost will be restored unto thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yudhishthira said: &#8220;So be it. I will stake Draupadi.&#8221;</p>

<p>At these words the whole company was stricken with
horror. Vidura swooned, and the faces of Bhishma and
Drona grew pallid; many groaned; but Duryodhana and
his brethren rejoiced openly before all men.</p>

<p>Shakuni threw the dice, and Yudhishthira lost this
the last throw. In this manner was Draupadi won by
Duryodhana.</p>

<p>Then all the onlookers gazed one upon another in
silence and wide-eyed. Karna and Duhsasana<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> and other
young princes laughed aloud.</p>

<p>Duryodhana rose proudly and spake unto Vidura,
saying: &#8220;Now hasten unto Draupadi and bid her to
come hither to sweep the chambers with the other bondswomen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vidura was made angry, and answered him:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> &#8220;Thy
words are wicked, O Duryodhana. Thou canst not
command a lady of royal birth to become a household
slave. Besides, she is not thy slave, because Yudhishthira
did stake his own freedom before he staked Draupadi.
Thou couldst not win aught from a slave who had no
power to stake the princess.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Duryodhana cursed Vidura, and bade one of his
servants to bring Draupadi before him.</p>

<p>Said Vidura: &#8220;Duryodhana is this day deprived of
his reason. Dishonesty is one of the doors to hell. By
practising dishonesty Duryodhana will accomplish yet the
ruin of the Kauravas.&#8221;</p>

<p>The beautiful Draupadi was sitting at peace within
the fair dwelling set apart for the Pandavas on the banks
of the Ganges; its walls and towers were mirrored on the
broad clear waters. Then suddenly, as a jackal enters
stealthily the den of a lion, the menial sent by Duryodhana
entered the palace and stood before high-born
Draupadi.</p>

<p>Said this man: &#8220;O queen, the mighty son of Pandu
hath played and lost; he hath lost all, even his reason,
and he hath staked thee, and thou hast been won by
Duryodhana. And now Duryodhana bids me to say
that thou art become his slave, and must obey him like
to other female slaves. So come thou with me, for thou
must henceforth engage in menial work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Draupadi was astounded when he spake these words,
and in her anguish she cried: &#8220;Have I heard thee aright?
Hath my husband, the king, staked and lost me in his
madness? Did he stake and loose aught beside?&#8221;</p>

<p>Said the man: &#8220;Yudhishthira hath lost all his riches
and his kingdom; he staked his brethren and lost them
one by one; he staked himself and lost; and then he
staked thee, O queen, and lost also. Therefore, come
thou with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Draupadi rose in her pride and spoke angrily, saying:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
&#8220;If my lord did stake himself and become a slave, he
could not wager me, for a slave owns neither his own
life nor the life of another. Speak, therefore, unto my
husband these words, and unto Duryodhana say: &#8216;Draupadi
hath not been won&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man returned to the assembly and spake unto
Yudhishthira the words which Draupadi had said, but
he bowed his head and was silent.</p>

<p>Duryodhana was made angry by the defiant answer
of the proud queen, and he said unto his brother Duhsasana:
&#8220;The sons of Pandu are our slaves, and thy heart
is without fear for them. Go thou to the palace and
bid the princess, my humble menial, to come hither
quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Red-eyed and proud Duhsasana hastened to the
palace. He entered the inner chambers and stood before
Draupadi, who was clad in but a single robe, while her
hair hung loosely.</p>

<p>Said the evil-hearted Kaurava: &#8220;O princess of Panchala
with fair lotus eyes, thou hast been staked and lost
fairly at the game of hazard. Hasten, therefore, and stand
before thy lord Duryodhana, for thou art now his bright-eyed
slave.&#8221;</p>

<p>Draupadi heard and trembled. She covered her eyes
with her hands before the hated Duhsasana; her cheeks
turned pale and her heart sickened. Then suddenly she
leapt up and sought to escape to an inner room. But
the evil-hearted prince seized her by the hair, for he
no longer feared the sons of Pandu, and the beautiful
princess quivered and shook in her loose attire like to
a sapling which is shaken by the storm wind. Crouching
on her knees, she cried angrily, while tears streamed from
her lotus eyes: &#8220;Begone! O shameless prince. Can a
modest woman appear before strangers in loose attire?&#8221;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>Said stern and cruel Duhsasana: &#8220;Even if thou wert
naked now, thou must follow me. Hast thou not become
a slave, fairly staked and fairly won? Henceforth thou
wilt serve among the other menials.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trembling and faint, Draupadi was dragged through
the streets by Duhsasana. When she stood before the
elders and the chieftains in the pavilion she cried: &#8220;Forgive
me because that I have come hither in this unseemly
plight....&#8221;</p>

<p>Bhishma and Drona and the other elders who were
there hung their heads in shame.</p>

<p>Unto Duhsasana Draupadi said angrily: &#8220;Cease thy
wickedness! Defile me no longer with unclean hands.
A woman's hair is sacred.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sacred indeed were the locks of the Pandava queen, for
they had been sprinkled with water sanctified by mantras
at the imperial sacrifice.</p>

<p>Weeping, she cried: &#8220;Hear and help me, O ye elders.
You have wives and children of your own. Will you
permit this wrong to be continued. Answer me now.&#8221;</p>

<p>But no man spake a word.</p>

<p>Draupadi wept and said: &#8220;Why this silence?...
Will no man among ye protect a sinless woman?...
Lost is the fame of the Kauravas, the ancient glory of
Bharata, and the prowess of the Kshatriyas!... Why
will not the sons of Pandu protect their outraged queen?...
And hath Bhishma lost his virtue and Drona his
power?... Will Yudhishthira no longer defend one
who is wronged?... Why are ye all silent while this
deed of shame is done before you?&#8221;</p>

<p>As she spake thus, Draupadi glanced round the sons
of Pandu one by one, and their hearts thirsted for vengeance.
Bhishma's face was dark, Drona clenched his
teeth, and Vidura, white and angry, gazed upon Duhsasana
with amaze while he tore off Draupadi's veil and addressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
her with foul words. When she looked towards the
Kaurava brethren, Duhsasana said: &#8220;Ha! on whom darest
thou to look now, O slave?&#8221;</p>

<p>Shakuni and Kama laughed to hear Draupadi called
a slave, and they cried out: &#8220;Well spoken, well spoken!&#8221;</p>

<p>Duhsasana endeavoured to strip the princess naked
before the assembly; but Draupadi, in her distress, prayed
aloud to Krishna, invoking him as the creator of all and
the soul of the universe, and entreated him to help her.
Krishna heard her, and multiplied her garments so that
Duhsasana was unable to accomplish his wicked purpose.</p>

<p>Karna spake to Draupadi and said: &#8220;'Tis not thy
blame, O princess, that thou hast fallen so low. A
woman's fate is controlled by her husband; Yudhishthira
hath gambled thee away. Thou wert his, and must
accept thy fate. Henceforward thou wilt be the slave
of the Kaurava princes. Thou must obey them and
please them with thy beauty.... 'Tis meet that thou
shouldst now seek for thyself a husband who will love
thee too well to stake thee at dice and suffer thee to be
put to shame.... Be assured that no one will blame
a humble menial, as thou now art, who looks with eyes
of love upon great and noble warriors. Remember that
Yudhishthira is no longer thy husband; he hath become
a slave, and a slave can have no wife.... Ah! sweet
Princess of Panchala, those whom thou didst choose at
thy swayamvara have gambled and lost thee; their kingdom
they have lost, and their power also.&#8221;</p>

<p>At these words Bhima's bosom heaved with anger
and with shame. Red-eyed he scowled upon Karna; he
seemed to be the image of flaming Wrath. Unto Yudhishthira
he spake grimly, saying:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span> &#8220;If you hadst not
staked our freedom and our queen, O king and elder
brother, this son of a charioteer would not have taunted
us in this manner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yudhishthira bowed his head in shame, nor answered
a word.</p>

<p>Arjuna reproved Bhima for his bitter words; but
Pritha's mighty son, the slayer of Asuras, said: &#8220;If I
am not permitted to punish the tormentor of Draupadi,
bring me a fire that I may thrust my hands into it.&#8221;</p>

<p>A deep uproar rose from the assembly, and the elders
applauded the wronged lady and censured Duhsasana.
Bhima clenched his hands and, with quivering lips, cried
out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear my terrible words, O ye Kshatriyas.... May
I never reach Heaven if I do not yet seize Duhsasana in
battle and, tearing open his breast, drink his very life
blood!...&#8221;</p>

<p>Again he spoke and said: &#8220;If Yudhishthira will permit
me, I will slay the wretched sons of Dhritarashtra without
weapons, even as a lion slays small animals.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Bhishma and Vidura and Drona cried out:
&#8220;Forbear, O Bhima! Everything is possible in thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Duryodhana gloried in his hour of triumph, and unto
the elder of the Pandava brethren spake tauntingly and
said: &#8220;Yudhishthira, thou art spokesman for thy brethren,
and they owe thee obedience. Speak and say, thou who
dost ever speak truly, hast thou lost thy kingdom and
thy brethren and thine own self? O Yudhishthira, hast
thou lost even the beauteous Draupadi? And hath she,
thy wedded wife, become our humble menial?&#8221;</p>

<p>Yudhishthira heard him with downcast eyes, but his
lips moved not.... Then Karna laughed; but Bhishma,
pious and old, wept in silence.</p>

<p>Then Duryodhana cast burning eyes upon Draupadi,
and, baring his knee, invited her, as a slave, to sit upon it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>Bhima gnashed his teeth, for he was unable to restrain
his pent-up anger. With eyes flashing like lightning, and
in a voice like to thunder he cried out: &#8220;Hear my vow!
May I never reach Heaven or meet my ancestors hereafter
if, for these deeds of sin, I do not break the knee of
Duryodhana in battle, and drink the blood of Duhsasana!&#8221;</p>

<p>The flames of wrath which leapt on the forehead of
Bhima were like red sparks flying from tough branches
on a crackling fire.</p>

<p>Dhritarashtra was sitting in his palace, nor knew
aught of what was passing. The Brahmans, robed in
white, were chanting peacefully their evening mantras,
when a jackal howled in the sacrificial chamber. Asses
brayed in response, and ravens answered their cries from
all sides. Those who heard these dread omens exclaimed:
&#8220;<i>Swashti! Swashti!</i>&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>Dhritarashtra shook with terror, and when Vidura had
told him all that had taken place, he said: &#8220;The luckless
and sinful Duryodhana hath brought shame upon the
head of Rajah Drupada's sweet daughter, and thus
courted death and destruction. May the prayers of a
sorrowful old man remove the wrath of Heaven which
these dark omens have revealed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the blind maharajah was led to Draupadi, and
before all the elders and the princes he spoke to her,
kindly and gently, and said: &#8220;Noble queen and virtuous
daughter, wife of pious Yudhishthira, and purest of all
women, thou art very dear unto my heart. Alas! my sons
have wronged thee in foul manner this day. O forgive
them now, and let the wrath of Heaven be averted. Whatsoever
thou wilt ask of me will be thine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Draupadi:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span> &#8220;O mighty maharajah, thou art merciful;
may happiness be thy dower. I ask of thee to set at
liberty now my lord and husband Yudhishthira. Having
been a prince, it is not seemly that he should be called
a slave.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dhritarashtra said: &#8220;Thy wish is granted. Ask a
second boon and blessing, O fair one. Thou dost deserve
more than a single boon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Draupadi: &#8220;Let Arjuna and Bhima and their
younger brethren be set free also and allowed to depart
now with their horses and their chariots and their
weapons.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dhritarashtra said: &#8220;So be it, O high-born princess.
Ask yet another boon and blessing and it will be granted
thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Draupadi: &#8220;I seek no other boon, thou generous
monarch: I am a Kshatriya by birth, and not like to a
Brahman, who craveth for gifts without end. Thou hast
freed my husbands from slavery: they will regain their
fortunes by their own mighty deeds.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the Pandava brethren departed from Hastinapur
with Pritha and Draupadi, and returned unto the
city of Indra-prastha.</p>

<p>The Kauravas were made angry, and Duryodhana
remonstrated with his royal sire and said: &#8220;Thou hast
permitted the Pandava princes to depart in their anger;
now they will make ready to wage war against us to
regain their kingdom and their wealth; when they return
they will slay us all. Permit us, therefore, to throw dice
with them once again. We will stake our liberty, and
be it laid down that the side which loseth shall go into
exile for twelve full years, and into concealment for a year
thereafter. By this arrangement a bloody war may be
averted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dhritarashtra granted his son's wish and recalled the
Pandavas. So it came to pass that Yudhishthira sat down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
once again to play with Shakuni, and once again Shakuni
brought forth the loaded dice. Ere long the game ended,
and Yudhishthira had lost.</p>

<p>Duhsasana danced with joy and cried aloud: &#8220;Now is
established the empire of Duryodhana.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Bhima: &#8220;Be not too gladsome, O Duhsasana.
Hear and remember my words: May I never reach
Heaven or meet my sires until I shall drink thy blood!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the Pandava princes cast off their royal garments
and clad themselves in deerskins like humble mendicants.
Yudhishthira bade farewell to Dhritarashtra and Bhishma
and Kripa and Vidura, one by one, and he even said farewell
to the Kaurava brethren.</p>

<p>Said Vidura: &#8220;Thy mother, the royal Pritha, is too
old to wander with thee through forest and jungle. Let
her dwell here until the years of your exile have passed
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yudhishthira spoke for his brethren and said: &#8220;Be it
so, O saintly Vidura. Now bless us ere we depart, for
thou hast been unto us like to a father.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Vidura blessed each one of the Pandava princes,
saying: &#8220;Be saintly in exile, subdue your passions, learn
truth in your sorrow, and return in happiness. May
these eyes be blessed by beholding thee in Hastinapur
once again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pritha wept over Draupadi and blessed her. Then
the Princess of Panchala went forth with loose tresses;
but ere she departed from the city she vowed a vow,
saying: &#8220;From this day my hair will fall over my forehead
until Bhima shall have slain Duhsasana and drunk
his blood; then shall Bhima tie up my tresses while his
hands are yet wet with the blood of Duhsasana.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Pandava princes wandered towards the deep forest,
and Draupadi followed them.</p>

<p>Yudhishthira lamented his fate to the Brahmans as he
wandered towards the forest. &#8220;Our kingdom is lost to
us,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and our fortune; everything is lost; we
depart in sorrow, and must live on fruits and roots and
the produce of the chase. In the woods are many perils&mdash;many
reptiles and hungry wild animals seeking their
prey.&#8221;</p>

<p>A Brahman advised the deposed rajah to call upon
the sun god, and Yudhishthira prayed: &#8220;O sun, thou art
the eye of the universe, the soul of all things that are;
thou art the creator; thou art Indra, thou art Vishnu,
thou art Brahma, thou art Prajapati, lord of creatures,
father of gods and man; thou art fire, thou art Mind;
thou art lord of all, the eternal Brahma.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Surya<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> appeared before Yudhishthira and gave
unto him a copper pot, which was ever filled with food
for the brethren.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>For twelve long years the Pandavas lived in the woods
with their wife Draupadi, and Dhaumya, the Brahman.
Whatever food they obtained, they set apart a portion for
the holy men and ate the rest. They visited holy shrines;
they bathed in sacred waters; they performed their devotions.
Ofttimes they held converse with Brahmans and
sages, who instructed them in pious works and blessed
them, and also promised them that their lost kingdom
would be restored in the fullness of time.</p>

<p>They wandered in sunshine and in shade; they dwelt
in pleasant places, amidst abundant fruits and surrounded
by flowers. They suffered also from tempests and heavy
rains, when their path would be torn by streams, and
Draupadi would swoon, and all the brethren would be
faint and weary and in despair. Then Bhima would carry
them all on his back and under his arms.</p>

<p>The gods appeared unto the brethren during their
exile. Dharma, god of wisdom and holiness, addressed
Yudhishthira his son many questions, which he answered
piously and well. Hanuman, son of Vayu, the wind god,
was made manifest before Bhima. It chanced that the
strong Pandava, who was also Vayu's son, was hastening
on his way and went swift as the wind; the earth shook
under him and trees fell down, and he killed at one touch
of his foot tigers and lions and even great elephants that
sought to obstruct his path.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> Hanuman shrank to the size
of an ape, but his tail spread out in such great proportions
across Bhima's path, that he was compelled to stay his
course and stand still. He spake to Bhima then and told
the tale of Rama and Sita. Then he grew suddenly as
lofty as Vindhya mountain and transported his brother, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>Pandava, to the garden of Kuvera,<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> King of Yakshas, lord
of treasure, who dwells in Mount Kailasa in the Himalayas;
then Bhima procured sweet-scented flowers, which
gave youth to those who had grown aged and turned grief
into joy, and these he gave unto Draupadi.</p>

<p>Krishna came to visit the Pandavas in the forest, and
Draupadi lamented before him, saying: &#8220;The evil-hearted
Duryodhana dared to claim me for his slave. Fie! fie!
upon the Pandavas because that they looked on in silence
when I was put to shame. Is it not the duty of a husband
to protect his wife?... These husbands of mine, who
have the prowess of lions, saw me afflicted, nor lifted a
hand to save.&#8221;</p>

<p>Draupadi wept bitter tears from her exquisite coppery
eyes, but Krishna at length comforted her, saying: &#8220;Thou
wilt yet live to see the wives of those men who persecuted
thee lamenting over their fallen husbands as they welter
in their life blood.... I will help the Pandavas, and thou
wilt be once again a queen over kings.&#8221;</p>

<p>Krishna said to Yudhishthira: &#8220;Had I been at Dwaraka
when thou wert called upon to visit Hastinapur, this unfair
match would not have taken place, for I would have warned
Dhritarashtra. But I was waging a war against demons....
What can I do, now that this disaster is accomplished?...
It is not easy to confine the waters after
the dam hath burst.&#8221;</p>

<p>After Krishna returned to his kingdom, Draupadi continued
to lament her fate. She said to Yudhishthira:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
&#8220;The sinful, evil-hearted Duryodhana hath a heart of
steel.... O king, I lie on the ground, remembering my
soft luxurious bed. I, who sit on a grass mat, cannot forget
my chairs of ivory. I have seen thee in the court of
monarchs; now thou art a beggar. I have gazed upon
thee in thy silken robes, who art now clad in rags....
What peace can my heart know now, O king, remembering
the things that have been? My heart is full of grief....
Doth not thy wrath blaze up, seeing thy brothers in
distress and me in sorrow? How canst thou forgive thy
cruel enemy? Art thou devoid of anger, Yudhishthira?...
Alas! a Kshatriya who doth not act at the right
moment&mdash;who forgiveth the foeman he should strike
down, is the most despised of all men. The hour hath
now come for thee to seek vengeance; the present is not
a time for forgiveness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said the wise Yudhishthira:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span> &#8220;Anger is sinful; it is
the cause of destruction. He that is angry cannot distinguish
between right and wrong. Anger slayeth one
who should be reverenced; it doth reverence to one who
should be slain. An angry man may commit his own
soul to hell. Know thou that wise men control their
wrath so as to achieve prosperity both in this world and
in the next. A weak man cannot control his wrath; but
men of wisdom and insight seek to subdue their passions,
knowing that he who is angry cannot perceive things in
their true perspective. None but ignorant people regard
anger as equivalent to energy.... Because fools commit
folly, should I who seek wisdom do likewise?... If
wrongs were not righted except by chastisement, the
whole world would speedily be destroyed, for anger is
destruction; it maketh men to slay one another. O fair
Draupadi! it is meet to be forgiving; one should forgive
every wrong. He who is forgiving shall attain to eternal
bliss; he who is foolish and cannot forgive is destroyed
both in this world and in the next. Forgiveness is the
greatest virtue; it is sacrifice; it is tradition; it is inspiration.
Forgiveness, O beautiful one! is holiness; it
is Truth; it is Brahma. By forgiveness the universe is
made steadfast.... The wise man who learns how to
forgive attaineth to Brahma (the highest god). O Draupadi,
remember thou the verses of the sage&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Let not thy wrath possess thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But worship peace with joy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who yieldeth to temptation<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That great god will destroy&#8217;.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He who is self-controlled will attain to sovereignty, and
the qualities of self-control are forgiveness and gentleness.
O let me attain with self-control to everlasting goodness!&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Draupadi: &#8220;I bow down before the Creator and
Ordainer of life and the three worlds, for my mind, it
seems, hath been dimmed. By deeds men are influenced,
for deeds produce consequences; by works are they set
free.... Man can never gain prosperity by forgiveness
and gentleness; thy virtue hath not shielded thee, O
king; thou art following a shadow.... Men should
not obey their own wills, but the will of the god who hath
ordained all things.... Yet O, methinks, as a doll is
moved by strings, so are living creatures moved by the
lord of all; he doth play with them as a child with a toy....
Those who have done wrong are now happy, and
I am full of grief and in sore distress. Can I praise thy
god who permits of such inequality? What reward doth
thy god receive when he alloweth Duryodhana to prosper&mdash;he
who is full of evil; he who doth destroy virtue and
religion? If a sin doth not rebound on the sinner, then
a man's might is the greatest force and not thy god, and
I sorrow for those who are devoid of might.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yudhishthira made answer:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span> &#8220;Alas! thy words are
the words of an unbeliever. I do not act merely for the
sake of reward. I give because it is right to give, and
I sacrifice because it is my duty so to do. I follow in
the paths of those who have lived wise and holy lives,
because that my heart turneth toward goodness. I am
no trader in goodness, ever looking for the fruits thereof.
The man who doubteth virtue will be born among the
brutes;<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> he will never attain to everlasting bliss. O do
not, thou fair one, doubt the ancient religion of thy
people! God will reward; he is the giver of fruits for
deeds; virtue and vice bear fruits.... The wise are
content with little in this world; the fools are not content
although they receive much, because they will have
no joy hereafter.... The gods are shrouded in mystery;
who can pierce the cloud which covers the doings of the
gods? Although thou canst not perceive the fruits of
goodness, do not doubt thy religion or the gods. Let
thy scepticism give room to faith. O do not slander the
great god, but endeavour to learn how to know him.
Turn not away from the Supreme One who giveth eternal
life, O Draupadi.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Draupadi: &#8220;I do not slander my god, the lord
of all, for in my sorrow I but rave.... But yet I hold
that a man should act, lest by inaction he is censured.
Without acts no one can live. He who believeth in
chance and destiny and is inactive, liveth a life of weakness
and helplessness which cannot last long. Success
comes to him who acts, and success depends on time
and circumstance. So hath a wise Brahman taught
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bhima then spoke, charging Yudhishthira with weakness,
and pleading with him to wrest the sovereignty
from Duryodhana: &#8220;O thou art like froth,&#8221; he cried;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
&#8220;thou art unripe fruit! O king, strike down thine
enemies! Battle is the highest virtue for a Kshatriya.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yudhishthira: &#8220;Verily, my heart burneth because
of our sufferings. But I have given my pledge
to remain in exile, and it cannot be violated, O Bhima.
Virtue is greater than life and prosperity in this world;
it is the way to celestial bliss.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they were all silent, and they pondered over
these things.</p>

<p>Now the Pandavas had need of celestial weapons, for
these were possessed by Drona and Bhishma and Karna.
In time, therefore, the holy sage Vyasa appeared before
Arjuna and bade him to visit Mount Kailasa, the high
seat of the gracious and propitious god Shiva, the three-eyed,
the blue-throated, and to perform penances there
with deep devotion, so as to obtain gifts of arms. So
Arjuna went his way, and when he reached the mountain
of Shiva he went through great austerities: he raised his
arms aloft and, leaning on naught, stood on his tiptoes;
for food he ate at first withered leaves, then he fed upon
air alone. Great was the fervour of his austerities, and
from the ground smoke issued forth. The Rishis pleaded
with Shiva, fearing disaster from the penances of Arjuna.
Then the god assumed the form of a hunter and went
towards Indra's warrior son, whom he challenged to
single combat. First they fought with weapons; then
they wrestled one with another fiercely and long, and
in the end Arjuna was cast upon the ground and he
swooned. When that brave Pandava regained consciousness
he made a clay image of Shiva, prostrated himself
and worshipped the gracious one, and made an offering
of flowers. Soon afterwards he beheld his opponent
wearing the garland he had given, and he knew that
he had wrestled with Shiva himself. Arjuna fell down
before him, and received from the god a celestial weapon
named Pasupata. Then a great storm broke forth, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
the earth shook, and the spirit of the weapon stood
beside Arjuna, ready to obey his will.</p>

<p>Next appeared Indra, king of gods, Varuna, god of
waters, Yama, king of the dead, and Kuvera, lord of
treasures, and they stood upon the mountain summit in
all their glory; unto Arjuna they gave gifts of other
celestial weapons.</p>

<p>Thereafter Indra transported his son to his own
bright city, the celestial Swarga, where the flowers always
bloom and sweet music is ever wafted on fragrant winds.
There he beheld sea-born Apsaras, the heavenly brides
of gods and heroes, and music-loving Gandharvas, who
sang songs and danced merrily in their joy. And Urvasi,
a fair Apsara of faultless form, with bright eyes and
silken hair, looked with love upon Arjuna; but she
sought in vain to subdue him, whereat she spoke scornfully,
saying: &#8220;Kama, god of love, hath wounded me
with his arrows, yet thou dost scorn me. For this, O
Arjuna, thou wilt for a season live unregarded among
women as a dancer and musician.&#8221;</p>

<p>Arjuna was troubled, but Indra said: &#8220;This curse
will work out for thy good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Arjuna abode in Indra's fair city for the space of five
years. He achieved great skill in music and in dance
and song. And he was trained also to wield the celestial
weapons which the gods had given unto him.</p>

<p>Now the demons and giants who are named the
Daityas and Danavas were the ancient enemies of Indra.
Certain of them there were who had their dwellings in
the lowest division of the underworld beneath the floor
of ocean, which is called Patala. And a day came when
Arjuna waged war with them. He rode forth in Indra's
great car, which went through the air like to a bird, and
Matali was the driver. When he reached the shore of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
the sounding sea, the billows rose against him like great
mountains, and the waters were divided; he saw demon
fish and giant tortoises, and vessels laden with rubies.
But he paused not, for he was without fear. The mighty
Arjuna was eager for battle, and he blew a mighty blast
upon his war shell: the Daityas and Danavas heard him
and quaked with terror.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> Then the demons smote their
drums and sounded their trumpets, and amidst the dread
clamour the wallowing sea monsters arose and leapt over
the waves against Indra's great son. But Arjuna chanted
mantras; he shot clouds of bright arrows; he fought with
his bright celestial weapons, and the furies were thwarted
and beaten back. Then they sent fire against him and
water, and they flung rocks like to great peaks; but he
fought on until in the end he triumphed, and slew all
that stood against him nor could escape.</p>

<p>Thereafter the valiant hero rode speedily towards the
city of demons and giants which is named Hiranyapura.
The women came out to lure him, calling aloud, and
their voices were like the voices of cranes. He heard
but paused not. All these evil giant women were driven
before him; in confusion they fled, terrified by the
clamour of Indra's celestial car and the driving of Matali,
and their ear-rings and their necklaces fell from their
bodies like to boulders tumbling and thundering adown
mountain steeps.</p>

<p>Arjuna reached the city of Hiranyapura and entered
it; and he gazed with wonder on mighty chariots with
ten thousand horses, which were many-coloured like to
gaily-plumaged peacocks, beautiful and stately and proud.
And he wrecked the dwellings of the Daityas and
Danavas.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>
<p>Indra praised his warrior son for his valour in overcoming
the demons and giants of ocean, and he gave
unto him a chain of gold, a bright diadem, and the war
shell which gave forth a mighty blast like to thunder.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p>During the years that Arjuna had his dwelling in
Indra's celestial city, Yudhishthira and his three younger
brethren, with Draupadi and the priest Dhaumya, abode
a time in the forest of Kamyaka. Great sages visited
them there, and from one Yudhishthira obtained skill in
dice. Others led the wanderers to sacred waters, in which
they were cleansed of their sins, and they achieved great
virtues. And the sages related unto them many tales
of men and women who suffered and made self-sacrifices,
undergoing long exiles and performing penances so as to
attain to great wisdom and win favour from the gods.</p>

<p>Thereafter the exiles went northward towards the
Himalayas, and at length they beheld afar off the dwelling
of Kuvera, lord of treasure and King of Yakshas. They
gazed upon palaces of crystal and gold; the high walls
were studded with jewels, and the gleaming ramparts and
turrets were adorned by dazzling streamers. They saw
beauteous gardens of bright flowers, and soft winds came
towards them laden with perfume; wonderful and fair
were the trees, and they were vocal with the songs of
birds.</p>

<p>Kuvera walked forth and spake words of wisdom
unto Yudhishthira, counselling him to be patient and
long-suffering, and to wait for the time and the place for
displaying Kshatriya prowess.</p>

<p>The exiles wandered on, and one day, when they
sighed for Arjuna, they beheld the bright car of Indra,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>and they worshipped Matali, the charioteer. Then Indra
came with his hosts of Apsaras and Gandharvas, and
when they had adored him, the god promised Yudhishthira
that he would yet reign in splendour over all men.</p>

<p>Arjuna appeared, and he was received with rejoicing,
and all the Pandavas returned together to Kamyaka.
There they were visited by Markandeya, the mighty sage,
whose life endures through all the world's ages, and he
spake of the mysteries and all that had taken place from
the beginning, and revealed unto them full knowledge of
the Deluge.</p>

<p>Now while the Pandavas were enduring great suffering
in the forest, Karna spake to Duryodhana and prevailed
upon him to spy upon their misery. So Dhritarashtra's
son went forth, as was the custom every three
years, to inspect the cattle and brand the calves. And
with him went Karna and many princes and courtiers,
and also a thousand ladies of the royal household. When,
however, they all drew nigh to the forest, they found that
the Gandharvas and Apsaras, who, as it chanced, had
descended to make merry there, would not permit the
royal train to advance. Duryodhana sent messages to
the Gandharva king, commanding him to depart with
all his hosts; but the celestial spirits feared him not, and
issued forth to battle. A great conflict was waged, and
the Kauravas were defeated. Karna fled, and Duryodhana
and many of his courtiers and all the royal ladies
were taken prisoners.</p>

<p>It happened that some of Duryodhana's followers
who took flight reached the place where the Pandavas
were, and told them how their kinsmen had been overcome.
Then Arjuna and Bhima and the two younger
brethren went forth against the Gandharvas and fought
with them until they were compelled to release the royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
prisoners. In this manner was the proud Duryodhana
humbled by those against whom he had cherished enmity.</p>

<p>Yudhishthira gave a feast to the Kauravas, and he
called Duryodhana his &#8220;brother&#8221;, whereat Duryodhana
made pretence to be well pleased, although his heart was
stung with deep mortification.</p>

<p>After this the sullen and angry Duryodhana resolved
to end his life. His friends remonstrated with him, but
he said: &#8220;I have naught to live for now, nor do I desire
friendship, or wealth, or power, or enjoyment. Do not
delay my purpose, but leave me each one, for I will eat
no more food, and I will wait here until I die. Return,
therefore, unto Hastinapur and reverence and obey those
who are greater than me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Duryodhana made a mat of grass, and, having
purified himself with water, sat down to wait for the end,
clad in rags and absorbed in silent meditation.</p>

<p>But the Daityas and Danavas<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> desired not that their
favourite rajah should thus end his life lest their power
should be weakened, and they sent to the forest a strange
goddess, who carried him away in the night. Then the
demons, before whom Duryodhana was brought, promised
to aid him in the coming struggle against the
Pandavas, and he was comforted thereat, and abandoned
his vow to die in solitude. So he returned speedily unto
Hastinapur and resumed his high position there.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards, when the princes and the elders sat
in council with the maharajah, wise old Bhishma praised
the Pandava princes for their valour and generosity, and
advised Duryodhana to offer them his friendship, so that
the kinsmen might ever afterwards live together in peace.
Duryodhana made no answer, and, smiling bitterly, rose
up and walked out of the council chamber. Bhishma
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>was made angry thereat, and departed also and went unto
his own house.</p>

<p>Then Duryodhana sought to rival the glory of
Yudhishthira by holding an Imperial sacrifice. Duhsasana,
with evil heart, sent messengers unto Yudhishthira,
inviting him to attend with his brethren; but Yudhishthira
said: &#8220;Although this great sacrifice will reflect
honour on all the descendants of King Bharata, and therefore
upon me and my brethren, I cannot be present because
our years of exile have not yet come to an end.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke calmly and with dignity, but Bhima was
made angry, and exclaimed: &#8220;Messengers of Duryodhana,
tell thy master that when the years of exile are
over, Yudhishthira will offer up a mighty sacrifice with
weapons and burn in consuming flames the whole family
of Dhritarashtra.&#8221;</p>

<p>Duryodhana received these messages in silence. And
when the sacrifice, which was called Vaishnava, was held,
Karna said unto Duryodhana: &#8220;When thou has slain
the Pandavas and canst hold thy Rajasuya<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>, I will be
present also to do homage unto thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Karna took a vow and said: &#8220;I will neither eat
venison nor wash my feet<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> until I have slain Arjuna.&#8221;</p>

<p>Spies hastened unto the Pandavas and related all that
had taken place at the sacrifice, and also the words which
Karna had spoken. When Yudhishthira heard of the
terrible vow which Karna had vowed, he sorrowed greatly,
for he knew that a day must come when Arjuna and
Karna would meet in deadly conflict.</p>

<p>One day thereafter Surya, god of the sun, warned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>Karna that Indra had resolved to divest him of his celestial
armour and ear-rings. &#8220;But,&#8221; said Surya, &#8220;thou canst
demand in exchange a heavenly weapon which hath power
to slay gods and demons and mortal men.&#8221;</p>

<p>So it came that Indra stood before Karna, disguised
as a Brahman, and asked for his armour and ear-rings.
Having vowed to give unto the Brahmans whatsoever
they might ask of him, Karna took off his armour and
ear-rings and gave them unto the king of the gods, from
whom he demanded in exchange an infallible weapon.
Indra granted his request, but smiled<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> and went upon his
way, knowing well that the triumph of the Pandavas was
now assured.</p>

<p>It chanced that one day after this that Jayadratha<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>,
Rajah of Sindhu, passed through the wood when the
Pandavas had gone a-hunting. He beheld Draupadi
with eyes of love, and, despite her warnings, carried her
away in his chariot.</p>

<p>When the Pandavas returned and were told by a
bondmaiden what had taken place, they set out in pursuit
of the Rajah of Sindhu, who left his chariot
when they drew nigh, and concealed himself in a
thicket.</p>

<p>Bhima then said unto Yudhishthira: &#8220;Return now
with Draupadi and our brethren. Although the rajah
should seek refuge in the underworld, he will not escape
my vengeance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yudhishthira: &#8220;Remember, O Bhima, that
although Jayadratha hath committed a grievous sin, he
is our kinsman, for he hath married the sister of
Duryodhana.&#8221;</p>

<p>Draupadi said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span> &#8220;He is worthy of death, for he is the
worst of kings and the vilest of men. Have not the
sages said that he who carries off the wife of another in
times of peace must certainly be put to death.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Bhima found Jayadratha, he cast him down and
cut off his hair except five locks; then the strong warrior
promised to spare the rajah's life if he would do homage
to Yudhishthira and declare himself his slave.</p>

<p>So the Rajah of Sindhu had to prostrate himself before
Yudhishthira as a humble menial. Thereafter he departed
in his shame and went unto his own country.</p>

<p>When the twelfth year of exile was nigh to an end,
the Pandava brethren bethought them to leave the forest.
But ere they went a strange and dread adventure threatened
them with dire disaster. It chanced that a stag carried
away upon its antlers the twigs with which a Brahman
was wont to kindle his holy fire. The Brahman appealed
to Yudhishthira to pursue the animal, and the Pandavas
endeavoured in vain to kill it or recover the sacred twigs.
Weary with the chase, they at length sat down to rest.
They were all athirst, and one of them climbed a banyan
tree to look for signs of water, for birds ever flutter over
pools. When it was discovered that a pond was nigh,
Yudhishthira sent Nakula towards it. The young man
approached the water, and ere he stooped he heard a
Voice which said: &#8220;Answer thou what I shall ask of thee
ere thou dost drink or draw water.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Nakula's thirst was greater than his fear, and he
drank of the waters; then he fell dead.</p>

<p>Sahadeva followed him, wondering why his brother
tarried. He too gazed greedily upon the pool, and he
too heard the Voice, but heeded not and drank; and he
fell dead also.</p>

<p>Arjuna next went towards the water. The Voice
spake to him, and he answered with anger:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> &#8220;Who art
thou that wouldst hinder me thus? Reveal thyself, and
mine arrows will speak to thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he drew his bow, and his shafts flew thick and
fast as raindrops. But his valour was as naught, for
when he drank he also fell dead like the others. Bhima
followed him, and stooped and drank, unheeding the
Voice, and he was stricken down like to Arjuna and
Nakula and Sahadeva.</p>

<p>At length wise Yudhishthira approached the pond.
He beheld his brethren lying dead, and sorrowed over
them. Then, as he drew nigh to the water, the Voice
spake once again, and he answered it, saying: &#8220;Who
art thou?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Voice said: &#8220;I am a Yaksha. I warned thy
brethren not to drink of this water until they had answered
what I should ask of them, but they disregarded
my warning and I laid them in death. If thou wilt
answer my questions thou canst, however, drink here
nor be afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yudhishthira: &#8220;Speak and I will answer thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Voice said: &#8220;Who maketh the sun to rise?
Who keepeth him company? Who maketh the sun to
go down? In whom is the sun established?&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yudhishthira: &#8220;Brahma maketh the sun to
rise; the gods accompany him; Dharma maketh the sun
to set; in truth is the sun established.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Voice said: &#8220;What sleepeth with open eyes?
What moveth not after birth? What is that which
hath no heart? What is that which swelleth of itself?&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yudhishthira: &#8220;A fish doth sleep with open
eyes; an egg moveth not after birth; a stone hath no
heart; a river swelleth of itself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Voice said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span> &#8220;What maketh The Way? What
is called Water? What is called Food? What is called
Poison?&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yudhishthira: &#8220;They that are pious make The
Way; space is called water; the cow is food<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>; a request
is poison.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Voice said: &#8220;Who is spoken of as the unconquered
enemy of man? What is spoken of as the
enemy's disease? Who is regarded as holy? Who is
regarded as unholy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yudhishthira: &#8220;Man's unconquered enemy is
anger, and his disease is covetousness; he who seeketh
after the good of all is holy; he who is selfishly cold is
unholy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Voice said: &#8220;Who are worthy of eternal
torment?&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yudhishthira: &#8220;He who sayeth unto the Brahman
whom he hath asked to his house, I have naught
to give; he who declareth the Vedas to be false; he who
is rich and yet giveth naught to the poor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many such questions did the Voice address to wise
Yudhishthira, and he answered each one patiently and
with knowledge. Then the Yaksha revealed himself in
the form of Dharma, god of wisdom and justice, for
behold! he was the celestial sire of Yudhishthira. Unto
his son he granted two boons; and Yudhishthira desired
that his brethren should be restored to life, and that they
should all have power to remain unrecognized by anyone
in the three worlds for the space of a year.</p>

<p>Ere the Pandavas left the forest, Yudhishthira invoked
the goddess Durga<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>, giver of boons, saying:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span> &#8220;O slayer of
the Buffalo Asura, thou art worshipped by the gods, for
thou art the protector of the three worlds. Chief of all
deities, protect thou and bless thou us. Confer victory
upon us, and help us in our distress.&#8221;</p>

<p>The goddess heard Yudhishthira, and confirmed the
promise of Dharma that the Pandava brethren and Draupadi
would remain unrecognized during the thirteenth and
last year of their exile.</p>

<p>Then the wanderers concealed their weapons in a tree,
and went together towards the city of Virata<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> so that they
might conceal themselves. According to the terms of
banishment, they would have to spend a further twelve
years in the jungle if the Kauravas discovered their
whereabouts.</p>

<p>The Pandavas found favour in the eyes of the rajah.
Yudhishthira became his instructor in the art of playing
with dice, because he was wont to lose heavily. Bhima
was made chief cook. Arjuna, attired as a eunuch, undertook
to teach dancing and music to the ladies of the
harem. Nakula was given care of horses, and Sahadeva
of kine. The queen was drawn towards Draupadi, who
offered to become a bondwoman on condition that she
should not have to wash the feet of anyone, or eat food
left over after meals; and on these terms she was engaged.
The queen feared that Draupadi's great beauty would
attract lovers and cause dispeace; but the forlorn woman
said that she was protected by five Gandharvas, and was
without fear.</p>

<p>Bhima soon won much renown by reason of his
matchless strength. At a great festival he overcame and
slew a wrestler from a far country who was named
Jimúta, and he received many gifts. The rajah took
great pride in him, and was wont to take him to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>apartments of the women, where he wrestled with caged
tigers and lions and bears, slaying each one at desire with
a single blow. Indeed, all the brothers were well loved
by the monarch because of their loyal services.</p>

<p>It chanced that the queen's brother, Kichaka<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>, a mighty
warrior and commander of the royal army, was smitten
with love for beautiful Draupadi, and at length he sought
to carry her away. But one night Bhima waited for him
when he came stealthily towards Draupadi, and after a
long struggle the strong Pandava slew him. Then Bhima
broke all this prince's bones and rolled up his body into
a ball of flesh.</p>

<p>Great was the horror of Kichaka's kinsmen when they
discovered what had happened, and they said: &#8220;No man
hath done this awful deed; the Gandharvas have taken
vengeance.&#8221;</p>

<p>In their wrath they seized Draupadi, to burn her on
the pyre with the body of Kichaka; but Bhima disguised
himself and went to her rescue, and he scattered her tormentors
in flight, killing many with a great tree which
he had uprooted.</p>

<p>The rajah was terror-stricken, and spake unto the
queen, and the queen thereafterwards asked Draupadi
to depart from Virata. But the wife of the Pandavas
begged to remain in the royal service yet a time; and
she said that her Gandharva protectors would serve the
rajah in his greatest hour of peril, which, she foretold,
was already nigh to him. So the queen bore with her,
and Draupadi tarried there.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards the Rajah of Trigartis, hearing that
mighty Kichaka was dead, plotted with the Kauravas at
Indra-prastha to attack the city of Virata with purpose to
capture the raj. Duryodhana agreed to aid him, so the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>Rajah of Trigartis invaded the kingdom from the north,
while the Kauravas marched against Virata from the
south.</p>

<p>It came to pass that on the last day of the thirteenth
year of the Pandavas' exile the first raid took place from
the north, and many cattle were carried off. Yudhishthira
and Bhima, with Nakula and Sahadeva, offered to give
their help when it became known that the Rajah of Virata
had been captured by his enemies. The Pandavas went
forth to rescue the monarch, and they routed the raiders
and rescued their prisoner; they also seized upon the Rajah
of Trigartis, and forced him to submit with humility to
his rival ere he was allowed to return to his own city.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Kauravas had advanced from the
south. Uttar<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>, son of the Rajah of Virata, went against
them, and Arjuna was his charioteer. When the young
man, however, beheld his enemies, he desired to flee,
but his driver compelled him by force to remain in the
chariot.</p>

<p>Then Arjuna procured his own weapons from the
tree in which they were concealed. Thus, fully armed,
he rode against the Kauravas, who said: &#8220;If this be
Arjuna, he and his brethren must go into exile for
another twelve years.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bhishma said: &#8220;The thirteenth year of concealment
is now ended.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Kauravas, however, persisted that Arjuna had
appeared ere the full time was spent.</p>

<p>Indra's great son advanced boldly. Suddenly he blew
his celestial war shell, and all the Kauravas were stricken
with fear, and they swooned and lay on the field like
men who slept. Arjuna forbore to slay them, and he
commanded Uttar to take possession of their royal attire.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>Then the great archer of the Pandavas returned to the
city with the rajah's son.</p>

<p>Now when the monarch discovered how Arjuna had
served him by warding off the attack of the Kauravas, he
offered the brave Pandava his daughter, Uttara, for a
bride; but Arjuna said: &#8220;Let her be given unto my son.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was then that the Pandava brethren revealed unto
the Rajah of Virata who they were. All those who had
assembled in the palace rejoiced greatly and honoured
them.</p>

<p>To the marriage of Abhimamju, son of Arjuna and
Subhadra, came many great rajahs. Krishna came with
his brother Balarama, and the Rajah Drupada came with
his son Dhrishta-dyumna.</p>

<p>Now the Rajah of Virata resolved to aid Yudhishthira
in obtaining back his kingdom from the Kauravas, who
protested that their kinsmen had been discovered ere yet
the complete term of exile was ended.</p>

<p>Shakuni, the cunning gambler, and the vengeful
Karna supported the proud and evil-hearted Duryodhana
in refusing to make peace with the Pandava brethren,
despite the warnings of the sages who sat around the
Maharajah Dhritarashtra.</p>

<p>Ere the wedding guests departed from Virata, after
merrymaking and song and dance, the elders and princes
and chieftains assembled in the council chamber. Drupada
was there with his son, and Krishna with his brother
Balarama and Satyaki his kinsman, and all the Pandava
brethren were there also, and many others both valiant
and powerful. Bright and numerous as the stars were
the gems that glittered on the robes of the mighty
warriors. For a time they spake kindly greetings one
to another, and jested and made merry. Krishna sat
pondering in silence, and at length he arose and spake,
saying:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;O rajahs and princes, may your fame endure for
ever! Thou knowest well that Yudhishthira was deprived
of his kingdom by the evil trickster Shakuni.
He hath endured twelve years of exile, and hath served,
like his brethren, as a humble menial for a further year in
the palace of the Rajah of Virata. After long suffering
Yudhishthira desires peace; his heart is without anger,
although he hath endured great shame. The heart of
Duryodhana, however, still burns with hate and jealous
wrath; still, as in his youth, he desires to work evil by
deceit against the Pandava brethren. Now, consider well,
O ye monarchs, what Yudhishthira should do. Should he
call many chieftains to his aid and wage war to punish
his ancient foes? Or should he send friendly messengers
to Duryodhana, asking him to restore the kingdom which
he still continues to possess?&#8221;</p>

<p>Balarama then spoke and said: &#8220;Ye pious rajahs!
ye have heard the words of my brother, who loveth
Yudhishthira. It is true, indeed, that the Kauravas have
wronged the Pandavas. Yet I would counsel peace,
so that this matter may be arranged between kinsmen.
Yudhishthira hath brought his sufferings upon his own
head. He was unwise to play with cunning Shakuni,
and also to continue playing, despite the warnings of the
elders and his friends. He hath suffered for his folly.
Now let a messenger be sent to Duryodhana, entreating
him to restore the throne unto Yudhishthira. I do not
advise war. What hath been gambled away cannot be
restored in battle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next arose Satyaki, the kinsman of Krishna. He said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
&#8220;O Balarama, thou hast spoken like to a woman. Thou
remindest me that weaklings are sometimes born to warriors,
like to barren saplings sprung from sturdy trees.
Timid words come from timid hearts. Proud monarchs
heed not counsel so weakly as thine. O Balarama! canst
thou justify Duryodhana and blame the pious-hearted and
gracious Yudhishthira? If it had chanced that Yudhishthira
while playing with his brethren had been visited by
Duryodhana, who, having thrown the dice, achieved success,
then the contest would have been fair in the eyes
of all men. But Duryodhana plotted to ruin his kinsman,
and invited him to Hastinapur to play with the
evil-hearted Shakuni, who threw loaded dice. But that
is ended. Yudhishthira hath fulfilled his obligation; his
exile is past, and he is entitled to his kingdom. Why,
therefore, should he beg for that which is his own? A
Kshatriya begs of no man; what is refused him he seizeth
in battle at all times.... Duryodhana still clings to
Yudhishthira's kingdom, despite the wise counsel of
Bhishma and Drona. Remember, O Balarama, it is not
sinful to slay one's enemies, but it is shameful to beg
from them. I now declare my advice to be that we
should give the Kauravas an opportunity to restore
the throne of Yudhishthira; if they hesitate to do
so, then let the Pandavas secure justice on the battlefield.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drupada, Rajah of Panchala, then arose and said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
&#8220;Ye monarchs, I fear that Satyaki hath spoken truly.
The Kauravas are a stubborn people. Methinks it is
useless to entreat Duryodhana, whose heart is consumed
with greed. It is vain to plead with Dhritarashtra, who is
but as clay in the hands of his proud son. Bhishma and
Drona have already counselled in vain. Karna thirsts for
war, and Duryodhana intrigues with him and also with
false and cunning Shakuni. Methinks it were idle to
follow the advice of Balarama. Duryodhana will never
yield up what he now possesseth, nor doth he desire
peace. If we should send to him an ambassador who
will speak mild words, he will think that we are weak,
and become more boastful and arrogant than heretofore.
My advice is that we should gather together a great army
without delay: the rajahs will side with him who asketh
first. Meanwhile let us offer peace and friendship unto
Duryodhana: my family priest will carry our message.
If Duryodhana is willing to give up the kingdom of
Yudhishthira, there will be peace; if he scorns our friendship,
he will find us ready for war.&#8221;</p>

<p>Krishna again addressed the assembly and said:
&#8220;Drupada hath spoken wisely. The Pandavas would do
well to accept his counsel. If Duryodhana will agree to
restore the raj unto Yudhishthira, there will be no strife
or bloodshed.... You all know that the Pandavas and
Kauravas are my kinsmen; know also that they are
equally dear unto me.... I will now go hence. When
ye send out messengers of war, let them enter my kingdom
last of all.&#8221;</p>

<p>After Krishna had returned home, he was visited by
Duryodhana and Arjuna, for both parties desired greatly
his help in the war. He spake to the rival kinsmen and
said: &#8220;Behold, I stand before you as in the balance; I
have put myself on one side, and all my army is on the
other. Choose now between you whether you desire me
or my forces. I shall not fight, but will give advice in
battle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Duryodhana asked for the army, but Arjuna
preferred to have Krishna alone. And Krishna promised
to be Arjuna's charioteer.</p>

<p>Duryodhana sought to prevail upon Balarama to aid
him, but Krishna's brother said: &#8220;I have no heart for
this war. I spake to Krishna in thy favour, but he
answered me not. Well, thou knowest that thou hast
wronged Yudhishthira, and that it would well become
thee to act justly in this matter. Do thy duty, and thy
renown will be great.&#8221;</p>

<p>Duryodhana departed in sullen anger from Balarama.</p>

<p>In time Drupada's priest appeared in the city of
Hastinapur, and the elders and princes sat with Dhritarashtra
to hear his message. Said the Brahman:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span> &#8220;Thus
speaketh the Pandavas&mdash;&#8216;Pandu and Dhritarashtra were
brothers: why, therefore, should Dhritarashtra's sons
possess the whole kingdom, while the sons of Pandu are
denied inheritance? Duryodhana hath ever worked evil
against his kinsman. He invited them to a gambling
match to play with loaded dice, and they lost their
possessions and had to go into exile like beggars. Now
they have fulfilled the conditions, and are prepared to
forget the past if their raj is restored to them. If their
rightful claim is rejected, then Arjuna will scatter the
Kauravas in battle.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Bhishma said: &#8220;What thou hast said is well justified,
but it is wrong to boast regarding Arjuna. It would be
wise of thee not to speak of him in such manner again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Angrily rose Karna and said: &#8220;If the Pandavas have
suffered, they are themselves to blame. It is but fitting
that they should plead for peace, for they are without
followers. If they can prove their right to possessions,
Duryodhana will yield; but he will not be forced by vain
threatenings, or because the Rajahs of Panchala and
Virata support them. O Brahman! tell thou the Pandavas
that they have failed to fulfil their obligations, for
Arjuna was beheld by us before the thirteenth year of
banishment was completed. Let them return to a jungle
for another term, and then come hither and submit to
Duryodhana and beg for his favours.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Bhishma: &#8220;Thou didst not boast in this manner,
O Karna, when Arjuna opposed thee at the Virata cattle
raid. Remember that Arjuna is still powerful. If war
comes, he will trample thee in the dust.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dhritarashtra reproved Karna for his hasty speech,
and said unto Bhishma: &#8220;He is young and unaccustomed
to debate; be not angry with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the blind old monarch sent his minister and
charioteer, Sanjaya, to the Pandavas to speak thus:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span> &#8220;If
you desire to have peace, come before me and I will do
justice. Except wicked Duryodhana and hasty Karna
all who are here are well disposed to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Sanjaya reached the Pandavas, he was astonished
to behold that they had assembled together a
mighty army. He greeted the brethren and delivered
his message.</p>

<p>Said Yudhishthira: &#8220;We honour Dhritarashtra, but
fear that he has listened to the counsel of his son Duryodhana,
who desires to have us in his power. The
maharajah offers us protection, but not the fulfilment
of our claims.&#8221;</p>

<p>Krishna then spake, saying: &#8220;The Pandavas have
assembled a mighty army, and cannot reward these
soldiers unless they receive their raj. It is not yet too
late to make peace. Deliver unto the Kauravas, O
Sanjaya, this message: &#8216;If you seek peace, you will have
peace; if you desire war, then let there be war.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Ere Sanjaya left, Yudhishthira spoke to him and
said: &#8220;Tell thou Duryodhana that we will accept that
portion of the raj which we ourselves have conquered
and settled: he can retain the rest. My desire is for
peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many days went past, and the Pandavas waited in
vain for an answer to their message. Then Yudhishthira
spake to Krishna, saying: &#8220;We have offered to make
peace by accepting but a portion of our kingdom, yet
the Kauravas remain silent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Krishna: &#8220;I will now journey unto Hastinapur
and address the maharajah and his counsellors on thy
behalf.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yudhishthira said: &#8220;Mayst thou secure peace between
kinsmen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Draupadi entered and, addressing Krishna, said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
&#8220;Yudhishthira is too generous towards the Kauravas in
offering to give up part of his kingdom unto them.
He entreateth them overmuch, as well, to grant him that
which belongs not unto them. If the Kauravas wage
war, my sire and many other rajahs will assist the
Pandavas.... Oh! can it be forgotten how Duhsasana
dragged me by the hair to the Gambling Pavilion,
and how I was put to shame before the elders and the
princes?...&#8221;</p>

<p>She wept bitterly, and Krishna pitied her. &#8220;Why
do you sorrow thus?&#8221; he asked with gentle voice. &#8220;The
time is drawing nigh when all the Kauravas will be laid
low, and their wives will shed tears more bitter than
thine that fall now, O fair one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Messengers who arrived at Hastinapur announced
the coming of Krishna. Wise Vidura counselled that
he should be welcomed in state, whereupon Duryodhana
proclaimed a public holiday, and all the people rejoiced,
and decorated the streets with streamers and
flowers.</p>

<p>Vidura was well pleased, and he said to Duryodhana:
&#8220;Thou hast done well. But these preparations are in
vain if thou art unwilling to do justice unto the Pandavas.&#8221;</p>

<p>Duryodhana was wroth, and said: &#8220;I will give naught
except what they can win in battle. If the success of
the Pandavas depends upon Krishna, then let us seize
Krishna and put him in prison.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dhritarashtra was horror-stricken, and cried out:
&#8220;Thou canst not thus treat an ambassador, and especially
an ambassador like unto Krishna.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bhishma rose up and said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span> &#8220;O maharajah, thy son
desireth to work evil and bring ruin and shame upon
us all. Methinks disaster is not now afar off.&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying, he departed unto his own house, and Vidura
did likewise.</p>

<p>All the Kauravas went forth to meet the royal ambassador
save Duryodhana, who scarcely looked upon
Krishna when he arrived at the palace.</p>

<p>Krishna went to the house of Vidura, and there he
saw Pritha, who wept and said: &#8220;How fares it with my
sons, whom I have not beheld for fourteen years? How
fares it with Draupadi? In sorrow have I heard of their
sufferings in desolate places. Ah! who can understand
mine own misery, for every day is full of weariness and
grief unto me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Krishna: &#8220;Be comforted, O widow of Pandu!
Thy sons have many allies, and ere long they will return
in triumph to their own land.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereafter Krishna went to the house of Duryodhana,
who sat haughtily in the feasting chamber. At length
Dhritarashtra's son spake unto his kinsman, who ate
naught. He said: &#8220;Why art thou unfriendly towards
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Krishna: &#8220;I cannot be thy friend until thou
dost act justly towards thy kinsmen, the Pandavas.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Krishna went again to the house of Vidura,
the aged counsellor said to him: &#8220;'Twere better if thou
hadst not come hither. Duryodhana will take no man's
advice. When he speaketh he doth expect all men to
agree with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Krishna: &#8220;It is my desire to prevent bloodshed.
I came to Hastinapur to save the Kauravas from destruction,
and I will warn them in the council chamber on
the morrow. If they will heed me, all will be well;
if they scorn my advice, then let their blood be upon
their own heads.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the princes and the elders sat with Dhritarashtra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
in the council chamber, Narada and other great
Rishis appeared in the heavens and were invited to come
down and share in the deliberations, and they came
down.</p>

<p>Krishna arose, and in a voice like thunder spake forth,
saying: &#8220;I have come hither not to seek war, but to
utter words of peace and love. O maharajah, let not
your heart be stained with sin. Thy sons have wronged
their kinsmen, and a danger threatens all: it approacheth
now like an angry comet, and I can behold kinsmen
slaying kinsmen, and many noble lords laid in the dust.
All of you here gathered together are already in the
clutch of death. O Dhritarashtra, man of peace, stretch
forth thine hand and avert the dread calamity which is
about to fall upon thy house. Grant unto the Pandavas
their rightful claim, and thy reign will close in glory
unsurpassed and in blessed peace.... What if all the
Pandavas were slain in battle! Would their fall bring
thee joy? Are they not thine own brother's children?...
But, know thou, the Pandavas are as ready for war
as they are eager for peace; and if war comes, it will be
polluted with the blood of these thy sons. O gracious
maharajah, let the last years of thy life be peaceful and
pleasant, so that thou mayst be blessed indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dhritarashtra wept and said: &#8220;Fain would I do as
thou hast counselled so wisely, O Krishna, but Duryodhana,
my vicious son, will not listen to me or obey, nor
will he give heed unto his mother, nor to Vidura, nor
unto Bhishma.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next Bhishma spoke, and he addressed Duryodhana,
saying: &#8220;'Twould be well with thee if thou wouldst
follow the advice of Krishna. Thou art evil-hearted and
a wrongdoer; thou art the curse of our family; thou
takest pleasure in disobeying thy royal sire and in scorning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
to be guided by Krishna and Vidura. Soon thy sire
will be bereft of his kingdom because of thy deeds; thy
pride will bring death to thy kinsmen. Hear and follow
my advice; do not bring eternal sorrow to thine aged
parents.&#8221;</p>

<p>Duryodhana heard these words in anger, but was
silent.</p>

<p>Then Drona spake to him and said: &#8220;I join with
Bhishma and Krishna in making appeal unto thee. Those
who advise thee to make peace are thy friends; those
who counsel war are thine enemies. Be not too certain
of victory; tempt not the hand of vengeance; leave the
night-black road of evil and seek out the road of light
and welldoing, O Duryodhana.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next Vidura rose up. He spoke with slow, gentle
voice, and said: &#8220;Thou hast heard words of wisdom,
O Duryodhana.... I sorrow deeply in this hour. My
grief is not for thee, but for thine aged sire and thine
aged mother, who will fall into the hands of thine
enemies; my grief is for kinsmen and friends who must
die in battle, and for those who will thereafter be driven
forth as beggars, friendless and without a home. The
few survivors of war will curse the day of thy birth,
O Duryodhana.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Bhishma spoke. He praised the valour of the
Pandavas, and said: &#8220;It is not yet too late to avoid
calamity. The field of battle is still unstained by the
blood of thousands; thine army hath not yet met the
arrows of death, O Duryodhana. Ere it is too late,
make thy peace with thy kinsmen, the Pandavas, so that
all men may rejoice. Banish evil from thine heart for
ever; rule the whole world with the heirs of Pandu.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dhritarashtra still wept.... The Rishis counselled
peace like the elders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>Then angry Duryodhana spoke, while his eyes burned
bright and his brows hung darkly, and said: &#8220;Krishna
counsels me to be just, yet he hateth me and loveth the
Pandavas. Bishma scowls upon me, and Vidura and
Drona look coldly on; my sire weeps for my sins. Yet
what have I done that ye, O elders, should turn my
sire's affection from me? If Yudhishthira loved gambling
and staked and lost his throne and freedom, am
I to blame? If he played a second time after being set
at liberty, and became an exile, why should he now call
me a robber? Pallid and inconstant is the star of the
Pandavas' destiny: their friends are few, and feeble is
their army. Shall we, who fear not Indra even, be
threatened and browbeaten by the weak sons of Pandu?
No warrior lives who can overcome us. A Kshatriya
fears no foeman; he may fall in battle, but he will never
yield. So have the sages spoken.... Hear me, my
kinsmen all! My sire gifted Indra-prastha to the Pandavas
in a moment of weakness. Never, so long as I
and my brother live, will they possess it again. Never
again will the kingdom of Maharajah Dhritarashtra be
severed in twain. It has been united, and so will remain
for ever. My words are firm and plain. So tell thou
the Pandavas, O Krishna, that they ask in vain for
territory. Nor town nor village will they again possess
with my consent. I swear by the gods that I will never
humble myself before the Pandavas.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Krishna: &#8220;How canst thou speak in such a manner,
O Duryodhana? How canst thou pretend that thou
didst never wrong thy kinsmen? Be mindful of thine
evil thoughts and deeds.&#8221;</p>

<p>Duhsasana whispered to his elder brother:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span> &#8220;I fear,
if thou dost not make peace with the Pandavas, the
elders will seize thee and send thee as a prisoner to
Yudhishthira. They desire to make thee and me and
Karna to kneel before the Pandavas.&#8221;</p>

<p>Angry was Duryodhana, and he rose and left the
council chamber. Duhsasana and Karna and Shakuni
followed him.</p>

<p>Krishna then turned to Dhritarashtra and said: &#8220;Thou
shouldst arrest these four rebellious princes and act freely
and justly towards the Pandavas.&#8221;</p>

<p>The weak old maharajah was stricken with grief, and
he sent Vidura for his elder son. Then came Queen
Gándhári and remonstrated with Duryodhana; but when
she had spoken he answered not, and went away again.</p>

<p>Shakuni and Karna and Duhsasana waited outside for
Duryodhana, and they plotted to lay hands on Krishna so
that the power of the Pandavas might be weakened. But
to Krishna came knowledge of their thoughts, and he
informed the elders who were there.</p>

<p>Once again the maharajah summoned Duryodhana
before him, and Krishna said: &#8220;Ah! thou of little understanding,
is it thy desire to take me captive? Know
now that I am not alone here, for all the gods and holy
beings are with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having spoken thus, Krishna suddenly revealed himself
in divine splendour. His body was transformed into
a tongue of flame; gods and divine beings appeared about
him; fire issued from his mouth and eyes and ears;
sparks broke from his skin, which became as radiant as
the sun....</p>

<p>All the rajahs closed their eyes; they trembled when
an earthquake shook the palace. But Duryodhana remained
defiant.</p>

<p>Krishna, having resumed his human form, then bade
farewell to the maharajah, who lamented the doings of
Duryodhana. The divine one spake and said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span> &#8220;O
Dhritarashtra, thee I forgive freely; but alas! a father is
often cursed by the people because of the wicked doings
of his own son.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ere Krishna left the city he met Karna and spake to
him, saying: &#8220;Come with me, and the Pandavas will
regard thee as their elder brother, and thou wilt become
the king.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Karna: &#8220;Although Duryodhana is a rajah, he
rules according to my counsel.... I know, without
doubt, that a great battle is pending which will cover the
earth with blood. Terrible are the omens. Calamity
awaits the Kauravas.... Yet I cannot desert those who
have given me their friendship. Besides, if I went with
thee now, men would regard me as Arjuna's inferior.
Arjuna and I must meet in battle, and fate will decide
who is the greater. I know I shall fall in this war, but
I must fight for my friends.... O mighty one, may we
meet on earth again. If not, may we meet in heaven.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Krishna and Karna embraced one another, and
each went his own way.</p>

<p>Vidura spake to Pritha, mother of the Pandavas, and
said: &#8220;O mother of living sons, my desire is ever for
peace, but although I cry myself hoarse, Duryodhana
will not listen to my words. Dhritarashtra is old, yet
he doth not work for peace; he is intoxicated with pride
for his sons. When Krishna returneth to the Pandavas,
war will certainly break out; the sin of the Kauravas
will cause much bloodshed. I cannot sleep, thinking of
approaching disaster.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pritha sighed and wept. &#8220;Fie to wealth!&#8221; she said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
&#8220;that it should cause kinsmen to slaughter one another.
War should be waged between foemen, not friends. If
the Pandavas do not fight, they will suffer poverty; if
they go to war and win, the destruction of kinsmen will
not bring triumph. My heart is full of sorrow. And
alas! it is Karna who supports Duryodhana in his folly;
he hath again become powerful.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pritha lamented the folly of her girlhood which
caused Karna to be, and she went forth to look for him.
She found her son bathing in sacred waters, and she
spoke, saying: &#8220;Thou art mine own son, and thy sire
is Surya. I hid thee at birth, and Radha, who found
thee, is not thy mother. It is not seemly that thou
shouldst in ignorance plot with Duryodhana against thine
own brethren. Let the Kauravas this day behold the
friendship of thee and Arjuna. If you two were side
by side you would conquer the world. My eldest son,
it is meet that thou shouldst be with thy brethren now.
Be no longer known as one of lowly birth.&#8221;</p>

<p>A voice spoke from the sun, saying: &#8220;<i>What Pritha
hath said is truth. O tiger among men, great good will be
accomplished if thou wilt obey her command.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Karna remained steadfast, for his heart was full of
honour. He said unto Pritha, his mother:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span> &#8220;O lady,
it is now too late to command my obedience. Why
didst thou abandon me at birth? If I am a Kshatriya,
I have been deprived of my rank. No foeman could
have done me a greater injury than thou hast done.
Thou hast never been a mother to me, nor do thy sons
know I am their brother. How can I now desert the
Kauravas, who trust in me in waging this war. I am
their boat on which to cross a stormy sea.... I will
speak without deceit unto thee. For the sake of
Duryodhana I will combat against thy sons. I cannot
forget his kindness; I cannot forget mine own honour.
Thy command cannot now be obeyed by me. Yet thy
solicitation to me will not be fruitless. I have power
to slay Yudhishthira, and Bhima, and Nakula, and Sahadeva,
but I promise they shall not fall by my hand. I
will fight with Arjuna alone. If I slay Arjuna, I will
achieve great fame; if I am slain by him, I will be
covered with glory.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Pritha: &#8220;Thou hast pledged the lives of four
of thy brethren. Be that remembered to thee in the
perils of battle. Blessed be thou, and let health be
given thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Karna said: &#8220;So be it,&#8221; and then they parted, the
mother going one way and the son another.</p>

<p>After this the Pandavas and Kauravas gathered together
their mighty armies and marched to the field of
battle.</p>

<p>Soon after Krishna had returned from Hastinapur,
Duryodhana sent a challenge to the Pandavas. His
messenger spake, saying:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span> &#8220;You have vowed to wage
war against us. The time has come for you to fulfil
your vow. Your kingdom was seized by me, your wife
Draupadi was put to shame, and you were all made
exiles. Why do you not now seek to be avenged in
battle? Where is drowsy Bhima, who boasted that he
would drink the blood of Duhsasana? Duhsasana is
weary with waiting for him. Where is arrogant Arjuna,
who hath Drona to meet? When mountains are blown
about like dust, and men hold back the wind with their
hands, Arjuna will take captive the mighty Drona....
Of what account was the mace of Bhima and the bow
of Arjuna on the day when your kingdom was taken
from you, and you were banished like vagabonds?...
Vain will be the help of Krishna when you meet us in
battle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Krishna answered the messenger, saying: &#8220;Vainly
dost thou boast of prowess, but ere long thy fate will
be made known unto thee. I will consume thine army
like to fire which consumeth withered grass. Thou wilt
not escape me, for I will drive the chariot of Arjuna.
And let Duhsasana know that the vow of Bhima will
ere long be fulfilled.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Arjuna: &#8220;Tell thou Duryodhana, &#8216;It is unseemly
for warriors to boast like women.... It is well
that Duhsasana cometh to battle.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>When the messenger spake these words to Duryodhana,
Karna said: &#8220;Cease this chatter! Let the drums
of war be sounded.&#8221;</p>

<p>So on the morrow at red dawn the armies of the
Kauravas and the Pandavas were assembled for battle
on the wide plain of Kuru-Kshetra. Bhishma, with his
large palmyra standard decked with five stars, had been
chosen to lead Duryodhana's army, and Karna, who had
quarrelled with him, vowed not to fight so long as the
older warrior remained alive. &#8220;Should he fall, however,&#8221;
Karna said, &#8220;I will go forth against Arjuna.&#8221;</p>

<p>The army of the Pandavas was commanded by
Dhrishta-dyumna, son of Drupada, and brother of Draupadi.
Among the young heroes were Arjuna's two sons,
the noble and peerless Abhimanyu, whose mother was
Krishna's fair sister Subhadra, and brave Iravat, whose
mother was Ulupi, the serpent nymph, daughter of the
king of the Nagas. Bhima's Rakshasa son, the terrible
Ghatotkacha, who had power to change his shape and
create illusions, had also hastened to assist his kinsmen.
Krishna drove the chariot of Arjuna, who carried his
celestial bow, named Gandiva, the gift of the god Agni;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
and his standard was the image of Hanuman, the chief
ape god, who was the son of Vayu, the wind god. Now
the army of Duryodhana was more numerous than the
army of Yudhishthira.</p>

<p>Drona led the right wing of the Kaurava forces,
which was strengthened by Shakuni, the gambler, and
his Gandhari lancers. The left wing was led by Duhsasana,
who was followed by Kamboja cavalry and fierce
Sakas and Yavanas mounted on rapid steeds. The
peoples of the north were there and the peoples of the
south, and of the east also.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> Blind old Dhritarashtra was
in the rear, and with him was Sanjaya, his charioteer, who
related all that took place, having been gifted with divine
vision by Vyasa.</p>

<p>Ere yet the conflict began, Yudhishthira walked unarmed
towards the Kauravas, whereat his kinsmen made
merry, thinking he was terror-stricken. But Pandu's
noble son first spake to Bhishma and asked permission
to fight against him. Bhishma gave consent. Then he
addressed Drona in like terms, and Drona gave consent
also. And ere he returned to his place, Yudhishthira
called out before the Kaurava army: &#8220;Whoso desireth
to help our cause, let him follow me.&#8221; When he had
spoken thus, Yuyutsu, the half-brother of Duryodhana,
made answer: &#8220;If thou wilt elevate me, I will serve thee
well.&#8221; Said Yudhishthira: &#8220;Be my brother.&#8221; Then
Yuyutsu followed Yudhishthira with all his men, and no
man endeavoured to hold him back.</p>

<p>When the armies were being set in order for battle,
Arjuna bade Krishna to drive his chariot to the open
space on which the struggle would take place. Indra's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>mighty son surveyed the hosts, and when he saw his
kinsmen, young and old, and his friends and all the
elders and princes on either side ready to fall upon one
another, his heart was touched, and he trembled with pity
and sorrow. He spake to Krishna, saying: &#8220;I seek nor
victory, nor kingdom, nor any joy upon earth. Those
for whose sake we might wish for power are gathered
against us in battle. What joy can come to us if we
commit the crime of slaying our own kinsmen?&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying, Arjuna let fall his celestial bow and sat
down on the bench of his chariot with a heart full of
grief.</p>

<p>Krishna admonished Arjuna, saying: &#8220;Thou art a
Kshatriya, and it is thy duty to fight, no matter what may
befall thee or befall others. So I command thee who
am responsible for thy doings. He who hath wisdom
sorroweth not for the living or for the dead. As one
casteth off old raiment and putteth on new, so the soul
casteth off this body and entereth the new body. Naught
existeth that is not of the soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>After long instruction, Krishna revealed himself to
Arjuna in his celestial splendour and power and said:
&#8220;Let thy heart and thine understanding be fixed in me,
and thou shalt dwell in me hereafter. I will deliver thee
from all thy sins.... I am the same unto all creatures;
there is none hateful to me&mdash;none dear. Those who
worship me are in me and I am in them. Those who
hate me are consigned to evil births: they are deluded
birth after birth, nor ever reach unto me.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>Arjuna gave ear unto the counsel of Krishna, and
prepared for the fray.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>
<p>Loudly bellowed the war shells, and the drums of
battle were sounded. The Kauravas made ready to
attack with horsemen, footmen, and charioteers, and elephants
of war. The Pandavas were marshalled to meet
them. And the air was filled with the shouting of men,
the roaring of elephants, the blasts of trumpets, and the
beating of drums: the rattling of chariots was like to
thunder rolling in heaven. The gods and Gandharvas
assembled in the clouds and saw the hosts which had
gathered for mutual slaughter.</p>

<p>As both armies waited for sunrise, a tempest arose
and the dawn was darkened by dust clouds, so that men
could scarce behold one another. Evil were the omens.
Blood dropped like rain out of heaven, while jackals
howled impatiently, and kites and vultures screamed
hungrily for human flesh. The earth shook, peals of
thunder were heard, although there were no clouds, and
angry lightning rent the horrid gloom; flaming thunderbolts
struck the rising sun and broke in fragments with
loud noise....</p>

<p>The undaunted warriors never faltered, despite these
signs and warnings. Shouting defiance, they mingled in
conflict, eager for victory, and strongly armed. Swords
were wielded and ponderous maces, javelins were hurled,
and numerous darts also; countless arrows whistled in
speedy flight.</p>

<p>When the wind fell and the air cleared, the battle
waxed in fury. Bhishma achieved mighty deeds. Duryodhana
led his men against Bhima's, and they fought with
valour. Yudhishthira fought with Salya, Rajah of Madra<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>;
Dhrishta-dyumna, son of Drupada, went against Drona,
who had captured aforetime half of the Panchala kingdom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>with the aid of the Pandavas. Drupada was opposed
to Jayadratha, the Rajah of Sindhu, who had endeavoured
to carry off Draupadi, and was compelled to acknowledge
himself the slave of Yudhishthira. Many single combats
were fought with uncertain result.</p>

<p>All day the armies battled with growing ardour.
When evening was coming on, Abhimanyu, son of
Arjuna, perceived that the advantage lay with the
Kauravas, chiefly because of Bhishma's prowess. So he
went speedily against that mighty warrior, and cut down
the ensign of his chariot. Bhishma said that never before
had he beheld a youthful hero who could perform greater
deeds. Then he advanced to make fierce attack upon
the Pandava army. Victoriously he went, cutting a
blood-red path through the stricken legions; none could
resist him for a time. The heart of Arjuna was filled
with shame, and he rode against Bhishma, whose advance
was stayed. The two heroes fought desperately until
dusk. Then Bhishma retired; but Arjuna followed him,
and pressed into the heart of the Kaurava host, achieving
great slaughter. The truce was sounded, and the first
day's battle came to an end.</p>

<p>Yudhishthira was despondent because that the fortunes
of war seemed to be against him; in the darkness he went
unto Krishna, who bade him to be of good cheer, and
Yudhishthira was comforted.</p>

<p>On the morning of the second day Bhishma again
attacked the Pandava forces, shattering their ranks; but
Arjuna drove him back. Perceiving this, Duryodhana
lamented to Bhishma that he had quarrelled with Karna.
The old warrior made answer: &#8220;Alas! I am a Kshatriya
and must fight even against my beloved kinsman.&#8221; Then
he rode against Arjuna once more, and the two warriors
contended fiercely and wounded one another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>Drupada's son waged a long combat with Drona, and
Bhima performed mighty deeds. He leapt on the back of
an elephant and slew the son of the Rajah of Maghadha<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>;
and he slew the rajah and his elephant also with a single
blow of his mace.</p>

<p>Towards evening a furious combat was waged by
Abhimanyu, son of Arjuna, and Lakshmana, son of
Duryodhana. The young Pandava was about to achieve
the victory, when Duryodhana came to his son's aid with
many rajahs. Shouts were raised: &#8220;Abhimanyu is in
peril; he will be overcome by force of numbers!&#8221; Arjuna
heard these words, and rode to the rescue. Thereupon
the Kauravas cried out in terror: &#8220;Arjuna! Arjuna!&#8221; and
scattered in flight. That evening Bhishma spake unto
Drona and said: &#8220;Methinks the gods are against
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the third day the army of the Pandavas advanced
in crescent formation and drove back the Kaurava army.
Many were slain, and rivers of blood laid down the dust;
horses writhed in agony, and the air was filled with the
shrieking and moaning of wounded men. Terrible were
the omens, for headless men rose up and fought against
one another; then the people feared that all who contended
in that dread battle would be slain.</p>

<p>When he beheld the broken cars, the fallen standards,
and the heaps of slain elephants and horses and men,
Duryodhana said to Bhishma: &#8220;Thou shouldst yield thy
place to Karna. Methinks thou art partial to Arjuna and
the Pandavas.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Bhishma:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span> &#8220;Thy struggle is in vain, foolish
Duryodhana. None can wipe out the stain of thy sins;
of no avail is cunning against a righteous cause. Verily,
thou shalt perish because of thy folly.... I have no
fear of battle, and I will lead the Kauravas until I triumph
or fall.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then angry Bhishma urged his charioteer to attack
the enemy; and he drove back all who opposed him, even
Arjuna. The fighting became general, nor did it end
until night obscured the plain.</p>

<p>Bhima was the hero of the fourth day of battle. He
swept against the Kauravas like a whirlwind; in vain
were darts thrown and arrows shot at the strong Pandava.
He wounded both Duryodhana and Salya, Rajah of
Sindhu. Then fourteen of Duryodhana's brethren rushed
to combat with him. Like the lion who licks his lips when
he beholds his prey drawing nigh, Bhima awaited them.
Brief and terrible was the conflict, and ere six princes fled
in terror, eight were slaughtered by the mighty Pandava.</p>

<p>Another day dawned, and Arjuna and Bhima advanced
in triumph until they were met and held back by Drona.
Once again the sons of Duryodhana and Arjuna sought
out one another. Mighty were their blows and swift,
and for a time all men watched them, wondering greatly.
At length Lakshmana was grievously wounded, and was
carried from the field by his kinsmen. Abhimanyu returned
in triumph to Yudhishthira. On that same day
were slain by Bhuri-sravas the ten great sons of Satyaki,
Krishna's kinsman.</p>

<p>Another day dawned, and it was a day of peril for
Bhima. Confident of victory, he pressed too far into
the midst of the Kaurava host, and was surrounded by
overwhelming numbers. Drupada perceived his peril
and hastened to help him, but neither could retreat.
Then Arjuna's fearless son, the slayer of Lakshmana,
with twelve brave chieftains shattered the Kaurava
hosts and rescued Bhima and Drupada from the surging
warriors who thirsted for their blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>The seventh day was the day of Bhishma. None
could withstand him in his battle fury. The Pandavas
quailed before him, nor could Bhima or Arjuna drive him
back. Ere night fell, the standard of Yudhishthira was
cut down, and the Kauravas rejoiced greatly, believing
that they would achieve a great victory.</p>

<p>On the day that followed, however, the tide of battle
turned. As Bhishma advanced, his charioteer was slain,
and the steeds took flight in terror. Then confusion fell
on the Kaurava army. For a time the Pandavas made
resistless advance amidst mighty slaughter. Then the
six Gandhari princes advanced to beat back the forces
of Yudhishthira. On milk-white steeds they rode, and
they swept like to sea birds across the ocean billows.
They had vowed to slay Iravat, son of Arjuna and the
Naga princess. The gallant youth feared them not and
fought triumphantly, stirred with the joy of battle; he
slew five of the princes, but the sixth, the eldest prince,
struck down Arjuna's son, who was plucked thus rudely
from life like to a fair and tender lotus. Terrible was
the grief of Arjuna when he was told that his son had
fallen. Then with tear-dimmed eyes he dashed upon
the foe, thirsting for vengeance; he broke through the
Kaurava ranks, and Bhima, who followed him, slew more
of Duryodhana's brethren.</p>

<p>Bhima's terrible son, the Rakshasa Ghatotkacha, also
sought to be avenged when Iravat fell. Roaring like the
sea, he assumed an awesome shape, and advanced with
flaming spears like the Destroyer at the end of Time, followed
by other Rakshasas. Warriors fled from his path,
until Duryodhana went against him with many elephants;
but Ghatotkacha scattered the elephant host. Duryodhana
fought like a lion and slew four Rakshasas, whereupon
Bhima's son, raging furiously, his eyes red as fire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
dashed against Duryodhana; but that mighty Kaurava
shot arrows like angry snakes, and he wounded his
enemy. Then a rajah urged his elephant in front of
Duryodhana's chariot for protection. Ghatotkacha slew
the great animal with a flaming dart. Next Bhishma
pressed forward with a division to shield Dhritarashtra's
son, and the Rakshasa fought fiercely; he wounded Kripa,
and with an arrow severed the string of Bhishma's bow.
Then the Panchalas hastened to aid Bhima's son, and the
Kauravas were scattered in flight.</p>

<p>Duryodhana was stricken with sorrow, and went to
the snow-white tent of Bhishma that night and spoke,
saying: &#8220;Forgive my harsh words, O mighty chieftain.
The Pandavas are brave in battle, but they are unable
to resist thee. If, however, thou dost love them too
well to overcome them utterly, let Karna take thy
place, so that he may lead the hosts against our
enemies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Bhishma: &#8220;Alas! Duryodhana, thy struggle is
of no avail. The just cause must win; they who fight
for the right are doubly armed. Besides, Krishna is with
the Pandavas: he drives Arjuna's car, and not even the
gods could strike them down. Thou art confronted by
utter ruin, O proud and foolish prince. I will fight as I
have fought until the end, which is not now far off.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the next day Bhishma was like a lordly elephant
which treads down the marsh reeds; he was like a fire
which burns up a dry and withering forest. In his
chariot he advanced triumphantly, and great was the
carnage which he wrought.</p>

<p>Yudhishthira was in despair, and spake to Krishna
when night fell. Krishna said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span> &#8220;Bhishma has vowed
that he will not slay one who had been born a woman,
knowing that the righteous would defame him if he slew
a female. Let Sikhandin<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> be therefore sent against him
with Arjuna.&#8221;</p>

<p>Arjuna said: &#8220;Alas! I cannot fight behind another,
or achieve the fall of Bhishma by foul means. I loved
him as a child; I sat upon his knee and called him
&#8216;Father&#8217;. Rather would I perish than slay the saintly
hero.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Krishna: &#8220;It is fated that Bhishma will fall on
the morrow, a victim of wrong. As he hath fought
against those whom he loveth, so must thou, Arjuna,
fight against him. He hath shown thee how Kshatriyas
must ever wage war, although their foemen be hated or
well beloved.&#8221;</p>

<p>Arjuna, being thus admonished, went forth on the
tenth day with Sikhandin, born a woman and made a
male by a Yaksha.</p>

<p>Once again Duryodhana sought to prevail upon
Bhishma to give place to Karna, and Bhishma answered
him in anger: &#8220;This day will I overcome the Pandavas
or perish on the field of battle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the ancient hero advanced and challenged
Arjuna. A terrible conflict ensued, and it lasted for
many hours; all the warriors on either side stopped
fighting and looked on. At length Sikhandin rushed
forward like a foaming billow, and when Bhishma saw
him his arms fell, for he could not contend against one
who had been born a woman. Then the arrows of
Arjuna pierced Bhishma's body, and the peerless old hero
fell from his chariot wounded unto death.... The sun
went down, and darkness swept over the plain.</p>

<p>There was great sorrow on the blood-drenched plain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>that night. Arjuna wept as a son weeps for a father, and
he carried water to Bhishma. Yudhishthira cursed the
day on which the war began. To the dying chieftain
came Duryodhana and his brethren also. Friends and
enemies lamented together over the fallen hero.</p>

<p>Bhishma spake to Duryodhana, saying: &#8220;Hear the
counsel of thy dying kinsman; his voice speaketh as from
the dead. If thy heart of stone can be moved, thou wilt
bring this slaughter of kinsmen by kinsmen to an end
now. Restore unto Yudhishthira his kingdom and make
thy peace with him, and let Pandavas and Kauravas be
friends and comrades together.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke in vain, for his words stirred the heart of
Duryodhana to hate his kinsmen the Pandavas with a
deeper hatred than before.</p>

<p>Karna came to the battlefield, and Bhishma said unto
him: &#8220;Proud rivals have we two been, jealous one of the
other, and ever at strife. My voice faileth, yet must I
tell thee that Arjuna is not greater than thou art on the
battlefield. Nor is he of higher birth, for thou art the
son of Pritha and the sun god Surya. As Arjuna is thine
own brother, 'twould be well for thee to bring this strife
to an end.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Bhishma spoke in vain. Karna hated his brother,
and thirsted for his life.</p>

<p>A guard was set round Bhishma, who lay supported
by a pillow of arrows, waiting the hour of his doom.
Nor did he die until after the great conflict was ended.</p>

<p>The Kauravas held a council of war, and they chose
Drona to be their leader. The battle standard of the
Brahman was a water jar and a golden altar upon a deerskin.
He vowed before Duryodhana that he would take
Yudhishthira prisoner.</p>

<p>On the first day of Drona's command, and the eleventh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
day of the great war, Abhimanyu was foremost in the
fight. He dragged a chieftain by the hair out of his
chariot, and would have taken him prisoner, but Jayadratha,
the rajah who had endeavoured to abduct Draupadi,
intervened, and broke his sword upon the young
man's buckler. Jayadratha fled, and Salya, Rajah of
Madra, attacked Arjuna's noble son. But Bhima dashed
forward and engaged him in fierce combat. Both were
mighty wielders of the mace; they were like two tigers,
like two great elephants; they were like eagles rending
one another with blood-red claws. The sound of their
blows was like the echoing thunder, and each stood as
steadfast as a cliff which is struck in vain by fiery lightning....
At length both staggered and fell, but Bhima
at once sprang up to strike the final blow. Ere he could
accomplish his fierce desire, however, Salya was rescued
by his followers and carried to a place of safety....
Thereafter the battle raged with more fury than ever,
until night fell and hid from sight all the dead and the
living.</p>

<p>Drona sought to fulfil his vow on the second day of
his command, and he prompted Susarman, the rajah who
had invaded Virata when the Pandavas were servants
there, to send a challenge for single combat to Arjuna.
Susarman selected a place apart. Arjuna fought many
hours, until he put the boastful rajah and his followers
to flight; then he taunted them for their cowardice.
Meanwhile Drona had dashed upon Yudhishthira, who,
when confronted by certain downfall, leapt on the back
of a swift steed and escaped from the battlefield. But it
was no shame for a Kshatriya to flee before a Brahman.</p>

<p>Duryodhana went against Bhima: he was wounded
after a brief combat, and retreated from the field. Many
warriors then pressed against Bhima, but Arjuna had returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
after fighting Susarman, and drove furiously against
the Kauravas; in triumph he swept over the blood-red
plain. Karna watched his rival with jealous wrath and
entered the fray. The fire burned redly in his eyes, and
he attacked Arjuna, resolved to conquer or to die. Uncertain
and long was the conflict, and when night fell the
two great warriors withdrew reluctantly from the field.</p>

<p>Drona on the morrow arranged his army like to a
spider's web, and once again Susarman challenged Arjuna,
so as to draw him from the battle-front. It was the day
of Abhimanyu's triumph and the day of his death. Yudhishthira
sent Arjuna's son to break the web of foemen,
and he rode his chariot against elephants and steeds with
conquering fury. Duryodhana attacked the youthful hero
with a band of warriors, but fell wounded by Abhimanyu,
who also slew the warriors. Salya next dashed against
Arjuna's son, but ere long he was carried from the field
grievously wounded. Then Duhsasana came forward,
frowning and fierce.</p>

<p>Abhimanyu cried out: &#8220;Base prince, who plotted with
Shakuni to win the kingdom of Yudhishthira and put
Draupadi to shame, I welcome thee, for I have waited
long for thee. Now thou wilt receive meet punishment
for thy sins.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spake, the fearless youth flung a dart, and
Duhsasana fell stunned and bleeding, but was rescued
from death by his followers.</p>

<p>Proudly rode Lakshmana, son of Duryodhana, against
Arjuna's son, and fought bravely and well; but he was cut
down, and died upon the battlefield.</p>

<p>Then it was that the evil Jayadratha, who had vowed
to be the slave of Yudhishthira in the forest, advanced
stealthily with six warriors to fight with the lordly youth.
Round him they surged like howling billows; alone stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
Abhimanyu, and seven were against him. His charioteer
was slain and his chariot was shattered; he leapt to the
ground and fought on, slaying one by one.... Perceiving
his peril, the Pandavas endeavoured to rescue
Arjuna's son; but Jayadratha held them back, and Karna
aided him. At length Abhimanyu was wounded on the
forehead, blood streamed into his eyes and blinded him,
and he stumbled. Ere he could recover, the son of
Duhsasana leapt forward and dashed out his brains with
a mace. So died the gallant youth, pure as he was at
birth. He died like to a forest lion surrounded by
hunters; he sank like to the red sun at evening; he perished
like to a tempest whose strength is spent; he was
spent out even like a fire which has consumed a forest
and is extinguished on the plain; Abhimanyu was lost as
is the serene white moon when shrouded in black eclipse.</p>

<p>So that day's battle ended, and Abhimanyu slumbered
in the soft starlight, lifeless and cold.</p>

<p>When it was told to Arjuna that his son was slain, the
mighty warrior wept silently and lay upon the ground.
At length he leapt up and cried: &#8220;May the curse of a
father and the vengeance of a warrior smite the murderers
of my boy!... May I never reach heaven if I do not
slay Jayadratha on the morrow....&#8221; A spy hastened
to the camp of the Kauravas and told of the vow which
Arjuna had taken. Jayadratha trembled with fear.</p>

<p>Early next morning Arjuna spake to Krishna, saying:
&#8220;Drive swiftly, for this will be a day of great slaughter.&#8221;
He desired to find Jayadratha; with him went Bhima and
Satyaki. Many warriors engaged them in battle, for the
Kauravas hoped to contrive that the sun should go down
ere Arjuna could fulfil his terrible vow.</p>

<p>Mounted on an elephant, Duhsasana opposed Arjuna;
but the lordly tusker took flight when the rattling chariot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
drew nigh. Drona blocked the way; but Arjuna refused
combat, saying: &#8220;Thou art as a father unto me....
Let me find the slayer of my son....&#8221; He passed on.
Then Duryodhana came up and engaged him. Karna
fought with Bhima, and Bhurisrava attacked Satyaki.
Long waged the bitter conflicts, and at length Krishna
perceived that his kinsman was about to be slain. He
called to Arjuna, who cast a celestial weapon at Bhurisrava,
which cut off both his arms; then Satyaki slew him.
Many warriors confronted Arjuna thereafter, and many
fell. But the day wore on and evening drew nigh, and
he could not find Jayadratha. At length Arjuna bade
Krishna to drive furiously onward, and to pause not
until he found the slayer of his son. The chariot sped
like to a whirlwind, until at length Arjuna beheld the
evil-hearted Jayadratha; he was guarded by Karna and
five great warriors, and at that time the sun had begun
to set.</p>

<p>Karna leapt forward and engaged Arjuna; but Krishna,
by reason of his divine power, caused a dark cloud to
obscure the sun, whereupon all men believed that night
had fallen. Karna at once withdrew; but Arjuna drove
on, and as the sun shot forth its last ray of dazzling light,
he dashed upon Jayadratha as a falcon swoops down upon
its prey. Brief was the struggle, for ere daylight faded
utterly, Arjuna overthrew the slayer of his son and cut
off his head. Bhima uttered a roar of triumph when he
saw the head of Jayadratha held aloft, and the Kauravas
sorrowed greatly because that their wicked design had
been thwarted.</p>

<p>Night fell, but the fighting was renewed. In the
darkness and confusion men slew their kinsmen, fathers
cut down their sons, and brothers fought against brothers.
Yudhishthira sent men with torches to light up the blood-red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
plain, and the battle was waged for many hours.
Swords were splintered and spears were lost, and warriors
threw great boulders and chariot wheels against one
another. All men were maddened with the thirst for
blood, and the night was filled with horrors.</p>

<p>At length Arjuna called for a truce, and it was agreed
that the warriors should sleep on the battlefield. So all
lay down, the charioteer in his chariot, the horseman on
his steed, and the driver of the elephant on his elephant's
back....</p>

<p>Duryodhana reproached Drona because that he did
not slay the Pandavas in their sleep.... &#8220;Let Karna,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;lead the hosts to victory.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Drona: &#8220;Thou art reaping the red harvest of
thy sins.... But know now that on the morrow either
Arjuna will fall or I will be slain by him.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the bright moon rose in the heavens the
conflict was renewed. Many fell on that awful night.
Ghatotkacha, the Rakshasa son of Bhima, was foremost in
the fray, and he slaughtered numerous Kaurava warriors.
At length Karna went against him, and then the air was
filled with blazing arrows. Each smote the other with
powerful weapons, and for a time the issue hung in the
balance. Ghatotkacha created illusions, but Karna kept
his senses in that great fight, even after his steeds had
been slain; he leapt to the ground, then flung a celestial
dart, the gift of Indra, and Ghatotkacha, uttering terrible
cries, fell down and breathed his last breath. The Kauravas
shouted with gladness, and the Pandavas shed tears
of sorrow.</p>

<p>Ere the night was ended, Drona slew his ancient
enemy Drupada, Rajah of Southern Panchala, and he
cut down also the Rajah of Virata.</p>

<p>Ere dawn broke, Dhrishta-dyumna, son of Drupada,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
went forth to search for Drona, the slayer of his beloved
sire.</p>

<p>Said Bhima: &#8220;Thou art too young to strike down
so great a warrior as Drona. I will fight with him until
he is wearied, then thou canst approach and be avenged.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bhima struggled with the sage, his preceptor, for
many hours; then Dhrishta-dyumna engaged him, but
neither could prevail over the slayer of Drupada.</p>

<p>At length the Pandava warriors shouted falsely:
&#8220;Aswatthaman, son of Drona, is slain.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Drona heard the dread tidings, he fainted in
his chariot, and vengeful Dhrishta-dyumna rushed forward
and cut off his head. Then the son of Drupada threw
the head of Drona towards Duryodhana, saying: &#8220;Here
is the head of thy mighty warrior; I will cut off the
heads of each Kaurava prince in like manner.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fall of Drona was like the sinking of heaven's
sun; it was like the drying up of the ocean; the Kauravas
fled away in fear.</p>

<p>Terrible was the grief of Aswatthaman when he
approached at eventide and found that his sire had been
slain. Night fell while he sorrowed, and he vowed to
slay Dhrishta-dyumna and all his kindred.</p>

<p>Karna was then chosen to be the leader of the Kaurava
army, and Duryodhana hailed him with joy and said:
&#8220;Thou alone canst stem the tide of our disasters. Arjuna
hath been spared by Bhishma and by Drona because that
they loved him. But the arm of Karna is strengthened
by hatred of the proud Pandava archer.&#8221;</p>

<p>When morning broke over the plain of Kuru-kshetra,
the first battle of Karna began, and it continued all day
long. Countless warriors were slain; blood ran in streams,
and the dead and mangled bodies of men and elephants
and horses were strewn in confusion. The air was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
darkened with arrows and darts, and it rang with the
shouts of the fighters and the moans of the wounded, the
bellowing of trumpets, and the clamour of drums.</p>

<p>At length evening came on and the carnage ended....
Duryodhana summoned a council of war and said:
&#8220;This is the sixteenth day of the war, and many of our
strongest heroes have fallen. Bhishma and Drona have
fallen, and many of my brethren are now dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Karna: &#8220;To-morrow will be the great day of the
war. I have vowed to slay Arjuna or fall by his hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Duryodhana was cheered by Karna's words, and all the
Kauravas were once more hopeful of victory.</p>

<p>In the morning Karna went forth in his chariot. He
chose for his driver Salya, Rajah of Madra, whose skill
was so great that even Krishna was not his superior.</p>

<p>Arjuna was again engaged in combat with Susarman
when Karna attacked the Pandava army. So the son of
Surya went against Yudhishthira and cast him on the
ground, saying: &#8220;If thou wert Arjuna I would slay
thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bhima then attacked Karna, and they fought fiercely
for a time, until Arjuna, having overcome Susarman, returned
again to combat with Karna.</p>

<p>Duhsasana, who put Draupadi to shame, came up to
help Karna, and Bhima sprang upon him. Now Bhima
had long desired to meet this evil-hearted son of the blind
maharajah, so that he might fulfil his vow. He swung
his mace and struck so mighty a blow that the advancing
chariot was shattered. Duhsasana fell heavily upon the
ground and broke his back. Then Bhima seized him
and, whirling his body aloft, cried out: &#8220;O Kauravas,
come ye who dare and rescue the helper of Karna.&#8221;</p>

<p>No one ventured to approach, and Bhima cast down
Duhsasana's body, cut off his head, and drank his blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
as he had vowed to do. &#8220;Ho! ho!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;never
have I tasted a sweeter draught....&#8221;</p>

<p>Many Kaurava warriors fled, and they cried out: &#8220;This
is not a man, for he drinketh human blood.&#8221;</p>

<p>All men watched the deadly combat which was waged
between the mighty heroes Arjuna and Karna. They
began by shooting arrows one at another, while Krishna
and Salya guided the chariots with prowess and care.
The arrows of Arjuna fell upon Karna like to summer
rain; Karna's arrows were like stinging snakes, and they
drank blood. At length Arjuna's celestial bow Gandiva
was struck and the bowstring severed....</p>

<p>Arjuna said: &#8220;Pause, O Karna. According to the
rules of battle, thou canst not attack a disabled foeman.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Karna heeded not. He showered countless
arrows, until his proud rival was wounded grievously
on the breast.</p>

<p>When Arjuna had restrung his bow, he rose up like
to a stricken and angry tiger held at bay, and cast a screen
of arrows against his foe. But Karna feared him not, nor
could Arjuna bear him down. The issue hung in the
balance....</p>

<p>Then suddenly a wheel of Karna's chariot sank in
the soft ground, nor could Salya urge the horses to
advance.</p>

<p>Karna cried out: &#8220;Pause now, O Arjuna, nor
wage unequal war. It is not manly to attack a helpless
enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Arjuna paused; but Krishna spake quickly, saying:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
&#8220;O Karna, thou speakest truly; but was it manly to
shoot arrows at Arjuna whilst he engaged himself restringing
his bow? Was it manly to scoff at Draupadi
when she was put to shame before elders and princes in
the gambling hall? Was it manly of thee and six warriors
to surround Abhimanyu so as to murder him without
compassion?&#8221;</p>

<p>When Arjuna heard his son's name, his heart burned
with consuming wrath. Snatching from his quiver a
crescent-bladed arrow, he drew his bow and shot it at
Karna, whose head was immediately struck off.</p>

<p>So fell in that dread combat a brother by a brother's
hand.</p>

<p>The Kauravas fled in terror when Karna was slain,
and Kripa said unto Duryodhana: &#8220;Now that our greatest
warriors are dead, it would be well to sue for peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Duryodhana: &#8220;After the wrongs I have done
the Pandavas, how can I ask or expect mercy at their
hands? Let the war go on till the end comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Salya was then chosen as the leader of the Kaurava
army, which had greatly shrunken in numbers, and on the
morning of the eighteenth day of the war the battle was
waged with fury. But the Pandavas were irresistible,
and when Duryodhana perceived that they were sweeping
all before them, he fled away secretly, carrying his mace.
He had power to hide under water as long as he desired,
by reason of a mighty charm which had been conferred
upon him by the demons; so he plunged into a lake and
lay concealed below the waters.</p>

<p>Salya was slain by Yudhishthira, and he fell like to a
thunder-splintered rock. Sahadeva overthrew false Shakuni,
the gambler, who had played against Yudhishthira
with loaded dice, and Bhima cut down all Duryodhana's
brethren who had survived until that last fateful day. Of
all the Kaurava heroes there then remained alive only
Aswa-thaman, son of Drona, Kripa, and Kritavarman, and
the hidden Duryodhana.</p>

<p>At length Bhima discovered where Duryodhana was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
concealed. Yudhishthira went to the lake side and urged
him to come forth and fight.</p>

<p>Said Duryodhana: &#8220;Take my kingdom now and have
pleasure in it. Depart and leave me, for I must retire to
the jungle and engage in meditation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yudhishthira said: &#8220;I cannot accept aught from thee
except what is won in battle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Duryodhana: &#8220;If you promise to fight one by
one, I will come out of the water and slay you all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yudhishthira said: &#8220;Come forth, and the battle will
be fought as thou dost desire. Now thou hast spoken as
becomes a Kshatriya.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still Duryodhana tarried, and Bhima shouted: &#8220;If
thou dost not come out of the lake at once, I will plunge
in and drag thee to the shore.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Duryodhana came forth, and the Pandavas
laughed to see him, for he was covered with mire, and
water streamed down from his raiment.</p>

<p>Said Duryodhana: &#8220;Soon will your merriment be
turned to grief.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, all during the time of the Pandava exile,
Duryodhana had practised with the mace, so that he
became the equal of Bhima. But he had no one to
support him there. The other survivors remained in
hiding. Then Balarama appeared, and he caused the
combat to be waged in the middle of the blood-red plain;
he was Duryodhana's supporter.</p>

<p>The warriors fought like two fierce bulls, and smote
one another heavy blows, until their faces were reddened
with blood. Once Duryodhana almost achieved victory,
for he struck Bhima on the head so that all present thought
that the Pandava hero had received his deathblow. Bhima
staggered but recovered himself, and soon afterwards he
struck Duryodhana a foul blow upon the knee, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
smashed the bone so that he fell prostrate. Thus was
the vow of Bhima fulfilled....</p>

<p>He danced round Duryodhana a time, then, kicking
his enemy's head, cried out at length: &#8220;Draupadi is
avenged.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yudhishthira was wroth; he smote Bhima on the face
and said: &#8220;O accursed villain, thou wilt cause all men
to speak ill of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Arjuna led Bhima away, and Yudhishthira knelt
beside Duryodhana and said: &#8220;Thou art still our ruler,
and if thou wilt order me to slay Bhima, thy command
will be obeyed. Thou art now very nigh unto death,
and I sorrow for the Kaurava wives and children, who
will curse us because that thou hast been laid low.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Balarama: &#8220;Bhima hath broken the laws of
combat, for he smote Duryodhana below the waist.&#8221;</p>

<p>Krishna said: &#8220;My brother, did not Duryodhana
wrong the Pandavas with foul play at dice? And did
not Bhima, when he beheld Draupadi put to shame, vow
to break the knee of Duryodhana?&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Balarama: &#8220;So thou dost approve of this?...
Can I forget that Bhima kicked the head of our wounded
kinsman, the rajah?&#8221;</p>

<p>Krishna stayed the vengeful hand of Balarama, and
prevailed upon him to take vows not to fight against the
Pandavas.</p>

<p>When night fell, the dying Duryodhana was visited
on the battlefield by Aswatthaman, son of Drona, and
Kripa, and Kritavarman. Unto Aswatthaman he gave
permission to attack the Pandavas while yet they
slumbered.... Then Drona's son went forth in the
darkness to glut his hunger for vengeance because that
his sire had been slain.... The pale stars looked down
on the dead and the dying as Aswatthaman crossed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
battleplain and went stealthily towards the tents of his
foemen, with Kripa and Kritavarman.</p>

<p>At the gate of the Pandava camp an awful figure rose
up against the conspirators. Aswatthaman was not afraid,
and he fought with his adversary until he perceived that
he was the god Shiva, the Blue-throated Destroyer.
Then Drona's son drew back, and on an altar he kindled
a fire to worship the all-powerful deity. Then, having
naught else to sacrifice, he cast his own body upon the
flames. By this supremely pious act Shiva was propitiated;
he accepted Drona's son and entered his body, saying:
&#8220;Hitherto, for the sake of Krishna, have I protected the
sons of Draupadi, but now their hour of doom hath
come.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Aswatthaman rushed into the camp and
slaughtered with the cruel arm of vengeance. Rudely
he awakened Dhrishta-dyumna, who cried out: &#8220;Coward!
wouldst thou attack a naked man?&#8221;</p>

<p>Aswatthaman answered not his father's slayer, but
took his life with a single blow.... Through the camp
he went, striking down each one he met, and shrieks and
moans arose on every side.</p>

<p>Draupadi was awakened by the clamour, and her five
young sons sprang up to protect her. Aswatthaman slew
each one without pity.... Then he lit a great fire to
discover those who had concealed themselves, and with
reeking hands he completed his ghastly work of slaughter.
Meanwhile Kripa and Kritavarman, with weapons in
their hands, kept watch at the gate, and cut down all who
endeavoured to escape.</p>

<p>Now the Pandava princes slept safely on that night of
horror in the camp of the Kauravas, so that they escaped
the sword of Drona's son.</p>

<p>When his fell work was accomplished, the bloodthirsty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
Aswatthaman cut off the heads of Draupadi's five
sons and carried them to Duryodhana, who rejoiced
greatly, believing that they were the heads of Yudhishthira
and his brethren. But when he perceived that the
avenger of night had slain the children of Draupadi
instead, he cried out: &#8220;Alas! what horror hast thou
committed? Thou hast slain innocent children, who,
had they lived, would have perpetuated our name and
our fame. My heart burns with anger against the sires
and not their harmless sons.&#8221;</p>

<p>Duryodhana groaned heavily: his heart was oppressed
with grief, and, bowing down his head, he died
sorrowing.</p>

<p>Then Aswatthaman and Kripa and Kritavarman fled
away, fearing the wrath of the Pandavas.</p>

<p>When it was told to the Pandava brethren that their
camp had been raided in darkness by the bloodthirsty
Aswatthaman, Yudhishthira exclaimed: &#8220;Alas! sorrow
upon sorrow crowds upon us, and now the greatest
sorrow of all hath fallen. Draupadi mourns the death
of her brother and her five sons, and I fear she will
perish with grief.&#8221;</p>

<p>Draupadi came before her husbands and, weeping
bitterly, said: &#8220;For thirteen cruel years you have endured
shame and exile so that your children might prosper. But
now that they are all slain, can you desire to have power
and kingdom?&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Krishna: &#8220;O daughter of a rajah, is thy grief
so great as is Pritha's and Gandhari's, and as great as
those who lament the loss or their husbands on the battlefield?
Thou hast less cause than others to wail now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Draupadi was soothed somewhat, but she turned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
Bhima and said: &#8220;If thou wilt not bring to me the head
of Aswatthaman, I will never again look upon thy face.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yudhishthira: &#8220;Aswatthaman is a Brahman, and
Vishnu, the greatest of the gods, will punish him if he
hath done wrong. If we should slay him now, O Draupadi,
thy sons and thy brother and thy sire would not
be restored unto thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Draupadi said: &#8220;So be it. But Aswatthaman hath
a great jewel which gleams in darkness. Let it be taken
from him, for it is as dear unto him as his life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Arjuna went in pursuit of Aswatthaman and
found him, and returned with the jewel.</p>

<p>To the battlefield came blind old Dhritarashtra,
mourning the death of his hundred sons. And with
the weeping maharajah were Queen Gandhari and the
wives of the Kaurava princes, who sorrowed aloud.
Wives wept for their husbands, their children wailed
beside them, and mothers moaned for their sons. Bitter
was the anguish of tender-hearted women, and the air
was filled with wailing on that blood-red plain of Kuru-kshetra.</p>

<p>When Queen Gandhari beheld the Pandavas she
cried out: &#8220;The smell of Duryodhana is upon you
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now Dhritarashtra plotted in his weak mind to
crush the head of Bhima, the slayer of Duryodhana.
When he embraced Yudhishthira he said: &#8220;Where is
Bhima?&#8221; and they placed before him an image of the
strong Pandava. Dhritarashtra put forth his arms, and
he crushed the image in his embrace and fell back fainting.
Then he wailed: &#8220;Alas! Bhima was as a son unto
me. Although I have slain him, the dead cannot return.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well pleased was the maharajah when it was told to
him that Bhima still lived; and he embraced his son's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
slayer tenderly and with forgiveness, saying: &#8220;I have
no children now save the sons of Pandu, my brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pritha rejoiced to meet her five sons, and she embraced
them one by one. Then she went towards the
sorrowing Draupadi, who fainted in her arms. Thereafter
they wept together for the dead.</p>

<p>The bodies of the slain rajahs and princes were
collected together, and wrapped in perfumed linen and
laid each upon a funeral pyre and burned, and the first
pyre which was kindled was that of Duryodhana. The
Pandavas mourned for their kinsmen. Then they bathed
in the holy Ganges, and took up water and sprinkled it
in the name of each dead hero. Yudhishthira poured out
the oblation for Karna, his brother, and he gave great gifts
to his widows and his children. Thereafter all the remaining
bodies of the slain were burned on the battlefield.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p>Yudhishthira was proclaimed rajah in the city of
Hastinapur, and he wore the great jewel in his crown.
A great sacrifice was offered up, and Dhaumya, the family
priest of the Pandavas, poured the Homa offering to the
gods on the sacred fire. Yudhishthira and Draupadi were
anointed with holy water.</p>

<p>In the days that followed, Yudhishthira lamented over
the carnage of the great war, nor could he be comforted.
At length Vyasa, the sage, appeared before him and advised
that he should perform the horse sacrifice to atone
for his sins.</p>

<p>Then search was made for a moon-white horse with
yellow tail and one black ear, and when it was found a
plate of gold, inscribed with the name of Yudhishthira,
was tied upon its forehead. Thereafter the horse was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>let loose, and was allowed to wander wheresoever it desired.
A great army, which was led by Arjuna, followed
the horse.</p>

<p>Now it was the custom in those days that when the
sacred horse entered a raj<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>, that raj was proclaimed to be
subject to the king who performed the ceremony. And
if any ruler detained the horse, he was compelled to fight
with the army which followed the wandering animal.
Should he be overcome in battle, the opposing rajah
immediately joined forces with those of the conqueror,
and followed the horse from kingdom to kingdom. For
a whole year the animal was allowed to wander thus.</p>

<p>The horse was let loose on the night of full moon in
the month of Choitro.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>Arjuna met with many adventures. He fought
against a rajah and the son of a rajah, who had a thousand
wives in the country of Malwa, and defeated them.
But Agni, who had married a daughter of the rajah, came
to rescue his kin. He fought against Arjuna with fire,
but Arjuna shot celestial arrows which produced water.
Then the god made peace, and the rajah who had detained
the horse went away with Arjuna. Thereafter
the horse came to a rock which was the girl-wife of a
Rishi who had been thus transformed because of her
wickedness. &#8220;So will you remain,&#8221; her husband had
said, &#8220;until Yudhishthira performs the Aswa-medha
ceremony.&#8221; The horse was unable to leave the rock.
Then Arjuna touched the rock, which immediately became
a woman, and the horse was set free.</p>

<p>In time the horse entered the land of Amazons, and
the queen detained it, and came forth with her women
warriors to fight against Arjuna, who, however, made
peace with them and went upon his way. Thereafter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>the holy steed reached a strange country where men
and women and horses and cows and goats grew upon
mighty trees like to fruit, and came to maturity and died
each day. The rajah came against Arjuna, but was
defeated. Then all the army fled to the islands of the
sea, for they were Daityas, and Arjuna plundered their
dwellings and obtained much treasure.</p>

<p>Once the horse entered a pond, and was cursed by
the goddess Parvati, and it became a mare; it entered
another pond and became a lion, owing to a Brahman's
spell.</p>

<p>In the kingdom of Manipura the horse was seized,
and soldiers armed with fire weapons were ready to fight
against the Pandavas and their allies. But when the
rajah, whose name was Babhru-váhana, discovered that
the horse bore the name of Yudhishthira, he said: &#8220;Arjuna
is my sire;&#8221; and he went forth and made obeisance,
and put his head under the foot of the Pandava hero.
But Arjuna spurned him, saying: &#8220;If I were thy sire,
thou wouldst have no fear of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the rajah challenged Arjuna to battle, and was
victorious on that day.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> He took all the great men
prisoners, and he severed Arjuna's head from his body
with a crescent-bladed arrow. The rajah's mother, Chitrangada,
was stricken with sorrow, as was also Ulupi,
the daughter of Vasuka, the king of serpents, who had
borne a son to Arjuna. But Ulupi remembered that her
sire possessed a magic jewel which had power to restore
a dead man to life, and she sent the rajah of Manipura
to obtain it from the underworld. But the Nagas refused
to give up the jewel, whereupon Arjuna's mighty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>son fought against them with arrows which were transformed
into peacocks; and the peacocks devoured the
serpents. Then the Naga king delivered up the magic
jewel, and the rajah returned with it. He touched the
body of Arjuna with the jewel, and the hero came to life
again, and all his wounds were healed. When he departed
from Manipura city the rajah, his son, accompanied
him.</p>

<p>So from kingdom to kingdom the horse wandered
while the army followed, until a year had expired. Then
it returned to Hastinapur.</p>

<p>Yudhishthira had meantime lived a life of purity and
self-restraint. Each night he lay upon the ground, and
always slept within the city. Beside him lay Draupadi,
and a naked sword was ever betwixt them.</p>

<p>Great were the rejoicings of the people when the
horse came back: they made glad holiday, and went forth
to welcome the army with gifts of fine raiment and jewels
and flowers. Money was scattered in the streets, and
the poor were made happy, being thus relieved generously
in their need.</p>

<p>Yudhishthira embraced Arjuna and kissed him and
wept tears of gladness, and welcomed Arjuna's son,
Babhru-váhana, Rajah of Manipura, and also the other
rajahs who had followed the sacred horse.</p>

<p>Twelve days after the return of Arjuna, and on the
day when Magha's full moon marked the close of the
winter season, the people assembled in great multitudes
from far and near to share Yudhishthira's generous hospitality
and witness the Aswa-medha ceremony, which was
held upon a green and level portion of consecrated
ground. Stately pavilions, glittering with jewels and
gold, had been erected for the royal guests, and there
were humbler places for the Brahmans. In thrones of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
gold sat Maharajah Dhritarashtra and Rajah Yudhishthira,
and the other rajahs had thrones of sandalwood and gold.
The royal ladies were ranged together in their appointed
places. Wise Vyasa was there, and he directed the ceremony.
And Krishna, the holy one, was there also.</p>

<p>When all the guests were assembled, Yudhishthira
and Draupadi bathed together in the sacred waters of
the Ganges. Then a portion of ground was measured
out, and Yudhishthira ploughed it with a golden plough.
Draupadi followed him, and sowed the seeds of every
kind which is sown in the kingdom, while all the women
and the Brahmans chanted holy mantras. Then a golden
altar was erected with four broad layers of golden bricks,
and stakes of sacred wood from the forest and from
Himalaya, and it was canopied and winged with gold-brocaded
silk.</p>

<p>Then eight pits were dug for Homa<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> of milk and
butter to be made ready for the sacrificial fire, and in
skins were wrapped up portions of every kind of
vegetable and curative herb which grew in the kingdom,
and these were placed in the Homa pits.</p>

<p>On the ground there were numerous sacrificial stakes,
to which were tied countless animals&mdash;bulls and buffaloes
and steeds, wild beasts from forest and mountain and cave,
birds of every kind, fishes from river and lake, and even
insects.</p>

<p>The priests offered up animals in sacrifice to each
celestial power, and the feasting was beheld by sacred
beings. The Gandharvas sang, and the Apsaras, whom
the Gandharvas wooed, danced like sunbeams on the
grass. Messengers of the gods were also gathered there,
and Vyasa and his disciples chanted mantras to celestial
music. The people lifted up their voices at the sound
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>of rain drum and the blast of the rain trumpet. Then
bright was the lustre of Yudhishthira's fame.</p>

<p>When all the kings and royal ladies and sages took
their places to be blessed by the horse sacrifice, Yudhishthira
sat on his throne, and in his hand he held the horn
of a stag.</p>

<p>Vyasa sent four-and-sixty rajahs with their wives to
draw water from the holy Ganges. Many musicians went
with them beating drums and blowing trumpets and playing
sweet instruments, and girls danced in front, going
and returning. And all the rajahs and their wives were
given splendid raiment by Yudhishthira, and necklaces of
jewels also, and he put betelnut in their mouths one by
one. To the Brahmans were gifted much gold and many
jewels, and elephants, horses, and kine, and they were
well pleased.</p>

<p>Yudhishthira then sat naked in his throne, and each
one who had drawn holy water poured a quantity over
his head; and they poured what remained over the head
of the sacred white horse.</p>

<p>Nákula held the horse's head, and said: &#8220;The horse
speaketh.&#8221;</p>

<p>Those who were about him asked in loud voices:
&#8220;What doth the horse reveal?&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Nákula: &#8220;Thus speaketh the horse&mdash;&#8216;In other
such ceremonies the horse which is sacrificed departs
unto Swarga<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>, but I shall rise far above Swarga, because
that Krishna is here&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Dhaumya, having washed the horse, gave a
scimitar to Bhima with which to strike off the head at
a single blow. But ere this was done, Dhaumya pressed
an ear of the holy animal, and milk flowed forth. Then
he said to Bhima:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span> &#8220;Pure indeed is the horse; verily the
gods will accept the sacrifice. Strike now, O strong
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bhima raised the scimitar and severed the head, which
immediately ascended unto heaven and vanished from before
the eyes of all. Great was the wonder and the joy
of the assembled multitude.</p>

<p>Krishna and other rajahs and sages then cut open
the horse's body, from which a bright light issued forth.
They found that the animal was pure, and Krishna said
unto Yudhishthira: &#8220;This, thy sacrifice, is acceptable unto
Vishnu.&#8221;</p>

<p>Draupadi was made Queen of the Sacrifice, and mantras
were chanted, and she was adored and given rich
offerings, because of her virtue and her wisdom.</p>

<p>The body of the slain steed was divided, and the flesh
gave forth the odour of camphor. Priests lifted portions
in their ladles and placed these on the sacrificial fire, and
they made Soma. And Rajah Yudhishthira and all his
brethren stood in the sin-cleansing smoke and breathed
its fragrance.</p>

<p>Dhaumya cried out, as he laid a piece of flesh on the
altar fire: &#8220;O Indra, accept thou this flesh which hath
turned to camphor.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he had uttered these words, Indra, accompanied
by many gods, appeared before the people, who made
obeisance with fear and secret joy. Indra took from
Vyasa portions of the flesh and gave these to each of the
gods. Then he vanished from sight with all his companions.</p>

<p>Vyasa blessed Yudhishthira, and Krishna embraced
him.</p>

<p>Said Krishna: &#8220;Thy fame will endure for ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yudhishthira made answer:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span> &#8220;Unto thee do I owe all
these blessings.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereafter Krishna and the rajahs poured holy water
over the heads of Yudhishthira and Draupadi.</p>

<p>All the fragments of the herbs which had been provided
for Homa were then ground into powder. And
Yudhishthira gave balls of the powder to each one present,
so that they might eat of the sacred herbs and share
in the blessings of the Aswa-medha. He ate his own
portion last of all. The fragments of the offerings which
remained were burnt on the altar.</p>

<p>Then Pritha and all the maidens who were with her
made merry, while the musicians played gladsome airs.</p>

<p>Yudhishthira distributed more gifts. Unto Vyasa he
assigned an estate, and bestowed upon the Brahmans who
officiated many animals and pearls and slaves. To the
rajahs he gave war elephants and steeds and money, and
to the rajahs' wives bridal-night gifts of raiment and
jewels and gold.</p>

<p>Bhima feasted all the Brahmans, and Yudhishthira
wept as he bade farewell to Krishna, his friend in peace
and in war, who departed in his chariot unto sea-washed
Dwaraka.</p>

<p>There was prosperity in the kingdom under Yudhishthira's
wise and just government; but blind old Dhritarashtra
never ceased to mourn the death of Duryodhana,
his first-born, and at length he retired to live in a humble
dwelling in the jungle. With him went Queen Gandhari,
and Pritha, the mother of the Pandavas, and Vidura, and
others who were of great age.</p>

<p>Years went past, and a day came when Yudhishthira
and his brethren and their wife Draupadi journeyed to
the dwelling-place of their elders. They found them all
there save Vidura, who had departed to a sacred place on
the banks of the Ganges to undergo penance and wait for
the coming of Yama, god of the dead. Then all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
kinsfolk, young and old, went forth to find Vidura; but
when they came to him he was wasted with hunger and
great age, nor could he speak unto them. They waited
beside him until he died, and then they mourned together.
This new sorrow awakened old-time grief, and they spoke
of all those who had fallen in the great war. Fathers
and mothers lamented for their sons, and wives for their
husbands....</p>

<p>While they wept and moaned together, the great
sage Vyasa came nigh and spoke, saying: &#8220;Verily, I
will soothe all your sorrows.... Let each one bathe at
sunset in the holy waters of the Ganges, and when night
falls your lost ones will return to you once again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they all sat waiting on the river bank until
evening came on. Slowly passed the day; it seemed to
be as long as a year.</p>

<p>At length the sun went down, and they chanted
mantras and went into the Ganges. Vyasa bathed beside
the old Maharajah Dhritarashtra and Yudhishthira....
Then all came out and stood on the bank.</p>

<p>Suddenly the waters began to heave and foam, and
Vyasa muttered holy words and called out the names of
the dead one by one.... Soon all the heroes who had
been slain arose one by one. In chariots they came, and
on horseback and riding upon lordly elephants. They
all uttered triumphant cries; drums were sounded and
trumpets were blown; and it seemed as if the armies of
the Pandavas and Kauravas were once again assembled
for battle, for they swept over the river like a mighty
tempest.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<p>Many of the onlookers trembled with fear, until they
beheld Bhishma and Drona, clad in armour, standing aloft
in their chariots in splendour and in pride; then came
Arjuna's son, the noble Abhimanyu, and Bhima's Asura
son. Soon Gandhari beheld Duryodhana and all his
brethren, while Pritha looked with glad eyes upon Karna,
and Draupadi welcomed her brother Dhrishta-dyumna
and her five children who had all been slain by vengeful
Aswatthaman. All the warriors who had fallen in battle
returned again on that night of wonder.</p>

<p>With the host came minstrels who sang of the deeds
of the heroes, and beautiful girls who danced before them.
All strife had ended between kinsmen and old-time rivals;
in death there was peace and sweet companionship.</p>

<p>The ghostly warriors crossed the Ganges and were
welcomed by those who waited on the bank around
Vyasa. It was a night of supreme and heart-stirring
gladness. Fathers and mothers found their sons, widows
clung to their husbands, sisters embraced their brothers,
and all wept tears of joy. The elders who were living
conversed with those who were dead; the burdens of
grief and despair fell from all hearts after lone years of
mourning; the past was suddenly forgotten in the rapture
of beholding those who had died.</p>

<p>Swiftly passed the night as if it had endured but for
an hour. Then when dawn began to break, the dead men
returned to their chariots and their horses and their elephants
and bade farewells....</p>

<p>Vyasa spoke to the widows and said that those of
them who desired to be with their husbands could depart
with them. Then the Kaurava princesses and other high-born
ladies, who never ceased to mourn for their own,
kissed the feet of the Maharajah Dhritarashtra and Queen
Gandhari and plunged into the Ganges with the departing
hosts.... Vyasa chanted mantras, and all the drowned
widows were transported to heaven with their husbands....</p>

<p>The Pandavas returned to Hastinapur, and when two
years had gone past a new sorrow fell upon them. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
day Narada, the sage, stood before Yudhishthira and told
that a great fire had swept through the jungle, and that
Dhritarashtra, and Gandhari, and Pritha, and all who
were with them, had perished.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards the Pandavas came to know, by
reason of dread omens which appeared, that a great
calamity was drawing nigh, but no man could tell what
it was or when it would take place.</p>

<p>Ere long it became known that the city of Dwaraka
was doomed to be destroyed. A horror in human shape
was beheld in the night; it was coloured yellow and
black, its head was bald and its limbs misshapen, and
men said it was Yama, god of the dead.... Visions of
headless men contending in battle were beheld at sunset....
The moon was eclipsed, a dread tempest ravaged
the land, and a plague of rats afflicted the city.</p>

<p>Krishna forbade all the people, on pain of death, to
drink wine, and commanded them to perform devotions
on the seashore....</p>

<p>Then the night was haunted by a black woman with
yellow teeth who grinned horribly at house doors. All
the inhabitants of the city were stricken with terror....
Evil spirits came also and robbed the jewels of the women
and the weapons of the men.... At length the chakra<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>
of Krishna went up to heaven, and his chariot and horses
followed it.... The end of the Yádavas was not afar
off, and the day came when Apsaras called out of heaven:
&#8220;Depart from hence,&#8221; and all the people heard them.</p>

<p>When the people gathered on the seashore they held
a feast, and being allowed to drink wine for one day, they
drank heavily and began to quarrel. At length Satyaki
slew Kritavarman, who had gone to the Pandava camp
with Drona's son on the night of slaughter. Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>Kritavarman's friends killed Satyaki and one of Krishna's
sons. Krishna slew the rebels, but he could not quell
the tumult and the fighting which ensued; fathers slew
their sons, and sons their fathers, and kinsmen contended
fiercely against kinsmen.</p>

<p>Then Krishna and Balarama left the city, and both
died in the jungle. From Balarama's mouth issued a
mighty snake, for he was the incarnation of the world
serpent.... Krishna was mistaken for a gazelle by a
hunter, who shot an arrow which pierced his foot at the
only spot where he could be mortally wounded. He
then departed to his heaven, which is called Goloka.</p>

<p>Ere Krishna had left Dwaraka he caused messengers
to hasten for Arjuna, who came speedily, to find the
women wailing for the dead. Then Vasudeva, father of
Krishna, died, and Arjuna laid the body of the old man
upon the pyre, and he was burned with four of his
widows, who no longer desired to live. The bodies of
Krishna and Balarama were cremated also.</p>

<p>Arjuna then set forth towards Indra-prastha with a
remnant of the people; and when they had left Dwaraka,
the sea rose up and swallowed the whole city, with those
who had refused to depart from it.... Such was the
end of the power of the Yadavas.</p>

<p>Deep gloom fell upon the Pandavas after this, and
Vyasa, the sage, appeared before them, and revealed that
their time had come to depart from the world.</p>

<p>Then Yudhishthira divided the kingdom. He made
Parikshit, son of Abhimanyu, Rajah of Hastinapur; and
Yuyutsu, the half-brother of Duryodhana, who had joined
the Pandava army on the first day of the great war, was
made Rajah of Hastinapur. He counselled them to live
at peace one with another.</p>

<p>The Pandavas afterwards cast off their royal garments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
and their jewels and put on the garb of hermits, and the
bright-eyed and faithful Draupadi did likewise. Yudhishthira
departed first of all, and his brethren walked behind
him one by one, and Draupadi went last of all, followed
by a hound. They all walked towards the rising sun,
and by the long circuitous path which leads to Mount
Meru, through forests and over streams and across the
burning plains, never again to return.</p>

<p>One by one they fell by the way, all save Yudhishthira.
Draupadi was the first to sink down, and Bhima
cried: &#8220;Why hath she fallen who hath never done
wrong?&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yudhishthira: &#8220;Her heart was bound up in
Arjuna, and she hath her reward.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sahadeva was next to fall, and then Nakula. At
length Yudhishthira heard the voice of Bhima crying in
distress: &#8220;Lo! now the noble Arjuna hath fallen. What
sin hath he committed?&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yudhishthira: &#8220;He boasted confidently that he
could destroy all his enemies in one day, and because he
failed in his vow he hath fallen by the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two surviving brothers walked on in silence; but
the time came when mighty Bhima sank down. He cried:
&#8220;O Yudhishthira say, if thou canst tell, why I have fallen
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yudhishthira: &#8220;O wolf-bellied one, because of
thy cursing and gluttony and thy pride thou hast fallen
by the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yudhishthira walked on, calm and unmoved, followed
by his faithful hound. When he drew nigh to sacred
Mount Meru, the world-spine, Indra, king of the gods,
came forth to welcome him, saying: &#8220;Ascend, O resolute
prince.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yudhishthira:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span> &#8220;Let my brethren who have fallen
by the way come with me also. I cannot enter heaven
without them, O king of the gods. Let the fair and
gentle princess come too; Draupadi hath been a faithful
wife, and is worthy of bliss. Hear my prayer, O Indra,
and have mercy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Indra: &#8220;Thy brethren and Draupadi have gone
before thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Yudhishthira pleaded that his faithful hound
should enter heaven also; but Indra said: &#8220;Heaven is
no place for those who are followed by hounds. Knowest
thou not that demons rob religious ordinances of their
virtues when dogs are nigh?&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yudhishthira: &#8220;No evil can come from the
noble. I cannot have joy if I desert this faithful friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>Indra said: &#8220;Thou didst leave behind thy brethren
and Draupadi. Why, therefore, canst thou not abandon
thine hound?&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Yudhishthira: &#8220;I have no power to bring back
to life those who have fallen by the way: there can be no
abandonment of the dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spake, the hound was transformed, and behold
Dharma, god of justice, stood by the rajah's side.</p>

<p>Dharma said: &#8220;O Yudhishthira, thou art indeed mine
own son. Thou wouldst not abandon me, thy hound,
because that I was faithful unto thee. Thine equal
cannot be found in heaven.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Yudhishthira was transported to the city of
eternal bliss, and there he beheld Duryodhana seated
upon a throne. All the Kauravas were in heaven also,
but the rajah could not find his brethren or fair Draupadi.</p>

<p>Said Indra:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span> &#8220;Here thou shalt dwell, O Yudhishthira,
in eternal bliss. Forget all earthly ties and attain to perfection;
thy brethren have fallen short, therefore they
sank by the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yudhishthira said: &#8220;I cannot remain here with the
Kauravas who have done me great wrong. Where my
brethren are, there would I be also with our wife Draupadi.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then a celestial being conducted Yudhishthira to the
abode of his brethren and the Princess of Panchala. He
entered the forest of the nether regions, where the leaves
were like to sharp weapons and the path was covered
with knives. Darkness hung heavily, and the way was
miry with blood and strewn with foul and mutilated
corpses. Shapes of horror flitted round about like to
shadows; fierce birds of prey feasted upon human flesh.
The damned were burning in everlasting fires, and the
air reeked with foul odours. A boiling river went past,
and Yudhishthira saw the place of torture with thorns, and
the desert of fiery sand: he gazed mutely upon each horror
that was unfolded before his eyes.</p>

<p>Fain would Yudhishthira have turned back, but he
heard in the darkness the voices of his brethren and
Draupadi bidding him to stay a little while to comfort
them while they suffered torment.</p>

<p>Then Yudhishthira said to the celestial being: &#8220;Depart
now from me, for I must remain here to assuage the
sufferings of my brethren and Draupadi.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spake the gods appeared, and the scene of horror
vanished from before the eyes of Yudhishthira, for it was
an illusion conjured up to test his constancy.</p>

<p>Then Yudhishthira was led to the heavenly Ganges,
and having bathed in its sacred waters, he cast off his
mortal body and became a celestial. Then, rejoicing,
he entered Swarga, the celestial city of Indra, and was
welcomed by Krishna in all his divine glory, and by his
brethren and by Draupadi, and all whom he had loved
upon earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p>Indra spoke and said: &#8220;This is the beautiful and immortal
one, who sprang from the altar to be thy wife,
and these bright beings are her five children. Here is
Dhritarashtra, who is now the king of the Gandharvas;
there is Karna, son of Surya, the peerless archer who was
slain by Arjuna. Here cometh towards thee Abhimanyu,
son of Arjuna; he is now the star-bright companion of the
lord of night.... Here are Pandu, thy sire, and Pritha,
thy mother, now united in heaven. Behold! also, Yudhishthira,
the wise Bhishma, whose place is with the
Vasus round my throne: Drona sits with Dharma, god
of wisdom. Here are all the peerless warriors who fell
in battle and have won heaven by their valour and
their constancy. So may all mortals rise to eternal
bliss, casting off their mortal bodies and entering by the
shining door of the celestial city, by doing kindly deeds,
by uttering gentle words, and by enduring all suffering
with patience. The holy life is prepared for all the sons
of men.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus ends sublimely the story of the Great War of
the Bharatas.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX_Nala_and_Damayanti" id="CHAPTER_XX_Nala_and_Damayanti">CHAPTER XX<br />Nala and Damayantí</a></h2>

<p class="blockcontents">A Noble Prince and Fair Princess&mdash;Swan Messengers of Love&mdash;A Royal

<p>Once upon a time there reigned in Nishadha<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> a great
rajah of choicest virtues whose name was Nala. He had
great skill in taming steeds; he was a peerless archer,
and was devoted to truth. Nala commanded a mighty
army: like to the sun was his splendour, and he was
exalted over all other kings as is the monarch of the
gods. He had withal great piety, and he was deeply
read in the Vedas, but he was ever a passionate lover
of dice. Many a high-born lady spoke his praises, for
he was generous of heart, and self-controlled, and the
guardian of law. Indeed, Nala was a very present
Manu.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<p>Now there ruled over the neighbouring state of
Vidarbha the mighty rajah Bhíma, the terrible in strength,
who was likewise of choicest virtues. He was childless,
and he yearned for children. For long he had been wont
to perform many holy deeds intent upon offspring, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>without avail.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> It chanced, however, that one day there
came to his court a Bráhman named Damana, and hospitable
welcome was accorded him by the child-desiring
Bhíma, for the seer was feasted in the hall with the rajah
and his royal consort. Thereafter a boon was conferred
upon the queen: she became the mother of one sweet
girl, the pearl of maidens, who was named Damayantí,
and of three noble sons, Dama, Danta, and the renowned
Dam´ana, who all grew great and powerful.</p>

<p>When fair Damayantí had attained the full bloom of
her beauty, she was unequalled throughout the world
for her brilliance and for her grace. Upon the faultless
and slender-waisted maiden there waited, as about
Indra's queen, a hundred female slaves and a hundred
virgin handmaids, and she shone among them, decked
with jewels and rich ornaments, like to the goddess of
beauty, unrivalled and without a peer. Never among
the gods, or the Yakshas, or among mortal men was a
maiden more fair ever heard of or ever beheld than
soul-disturbing Damayantí, who disturbed the souls of
the gods.</p>

<p>In presence of Bhima's sweet daughter the high-born
ladies of Vidarbha took joy in constantly praising Nala,
that tiger among rajahs. Likewise before Nishadha's
king was Damayantí ever extolled because of her beauty.
So it fell that, hearing much of each other's virtues, the
silent passion of love was nurtured in both their hearts.</p>

<p>Impatient grew Nala as his love increased, and he
was wont to wander in a grove within his palace garden
musing secretly upon the maiden of faultless form. One
day he saw disporting in the grounds a flock of beautiful
swans with wings all flecked with gold. The rajah crept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>forward softly and seized one, and much he marvelled to
hear it cry out in human language.</p>

<p>&#8220;Slay me not, O gentle king, and to thee I will
render a service, for I will praise thee in the presence
of Damayantí so that ever after she shall think of no
other mortal man but thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Immediately Nala set the bird at liberty, and it flew
away rejoicing with its bright companions towards Vidarbha.
When they reached the ladies' garden of Bhima's
palace they settled down at the feet of Damayantí, who
was reposing in the shade with her virgin handmaids.
All the fair young women gazed in wonder on the swans,
admiring their graceful forms and their plumage gleaming
with gold, and ere long they began to pursue them among
the trees. Then of a sudden the bird which Damayantí
followed spoke to her in human language and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Damayantí, hear! The noble king Nala dwells in
Nishadha. Comely is he as a god, nor can his equal be
found in the world. Thou art the pearl of women, and
he is the pride of men. If thou wert wed to him, then
would perfect beauty and noble birth be united. Blessed
indeed would be the union of the peerless with the peerless.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wondering, the maiden listened while the bird conversed
thus strangely, and then she said: &#8220;Speak also
unto Nala in this manner.&#8221;</p>

<p>The swan made answer: &#8220;So be it,&#8221; and thereupon
took flight with the others to Nishadha, where it related
unto Nala all that had taken place.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></p>

<p>Ever after that day Damayantí ceased to live for herself
alone; all her thoughts were given up to Nala. She
desired most to sit apart in silent reverie; the bloom
faded from her cheeks, and she grew dejected and melancholy.
Indeed, the maiden yielded up her soul to sorrow,
and much she sighed in secret, gazing upward and meditating,
for love had taken possession of her heart; nor
did she find pleasure in sleep, or in gentle converse, or in
merry banquets. In the midst of her broken slumbers she
was wont to weep and cry out: &#8220;Oh, woe is me!&#8221;</p>

<p>The virgin handmaidens read her heart, and they
went before her sire and told that his gentle daughter
was pining for the monarch among men. When Bhima
heard this, he pondered deeply what should be done for
Damayantí, and he perceived that her time for the
swayamvara<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> had come. So he summoned all the
high-born rajahs upon earth, saying: &#8220;O heroes of the
world, come ye to the swayamvara.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then did the whole land resound with the trampling
of elephants and horses and the rumbling of chariots,
for the stately princes, followed by their armies, swarmed
towards the court of Bhima. By the strong lord of Vidarbha
were they welcomed with honour, and they sat upon
their thrones.</p>

<p>Now it happened that at this time these two wise
sages, Nárada and Párvata,<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> ascended Mount Meru to
Swarga, the heaven of Indra, and they saluted the Cloud-compeller
within his palace. The immortal lord bade
them welcome, and asked how it fared with the world.
Narada said it fared well with the world and with all the
mighty kings. Then Indra spake, saying: &#8220;Where are
all the royal heroes? Why do they not come hither as
my honoured guests?&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>The wise sage made answer and said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span> &#8220;O Cloud-compeller,
the great rajahs cannot appear before thee
because even now they are hastening one and all to
the swayamvara of Damayantí, the renowned daughter
of Bhima, the fairest woman upon earth. O slayer of
drought demons, every king seeks to woo this maid of
transcending beauty, for she is the pearl of all the
world.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Narada spake, the other gods drew nigh and listened
to his stately utterance. Then together they exclaimed
with rapture: &#8220;We also will go thither....&#8221; In an instant
they were hastening through the air in their chariots
towards the city of Vidarbha to mingle with the wooers
of Bhima's fair daughter.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Nala had set forth with joy, his heart full
of love for Damayantí. The gods beheld him standing
upon the surface of the earth with radiance like to the sun,
and they arrested their course, gazing in mute wonder,
for he was as comely as the god of love. Then, dropping
down through the blue air, they hailed the stately hero,
saying: &#8220;Do as we now beseech thee, O most excellent of
princes; be thou the bearer of our message.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nala adored the gods with folded hands and promised
to obey their will, saying humbly: &#8220;Who are ye that now
command my service?&#8221;</p>

<p>Indra spoke and said: &#8220;Lo! we are the dread guardians
of the world. I am Indra, lord of heaven; yon
is Agni, god of fire; here is Varuna, king of the waters;
and there is Yama, lord of the dead.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> Thou must inform
Damayantí that we have come to woo her and say to her:
&#8216;<i>Choose for thine husband one of the celestial beings</i>&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nala made answer with folded hands, saying:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span> &#8220;Send
me not, I entreat thee, upon this mission. How can I
who am enamoured with the maiden, plead aright the cause
of another. In mercy spare me, ye gods&mdash;spare me this
unwelcome service.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the gods would not be moved from their purpose.
They reminded Nala he had already promised to do their
will, and they therefore urged him to set forth without
delay lest he should belie his words.</p>

<p>Then the lord of Nishadha pleaded: &#8220;The palace of
Bhima is strongly guarded, and I cannot enter there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Indra said: &#8220;Thou wilt indeed enter.&#8221;</p>

<p>And lo! even as the god spake, Nala found himself
standing before Damayantí in her secret bower.</p>

<p>The beauteous maiden was surrounded by her virgin
band, and he gazed upon her faultless limbs and slender
waist and into her entrancing eyes. Her shining beauty
excelled even the tender rays of the moon. The love of
Nala grew deeper and stronger as he looked upon the
smiling princess; but he curbed his passion, remembering
his mission.</p>

<p>All the maidens gazed with wonder and joy at the
noble form, and in their hearts they exclaimed: &#8220;Oh! the
splendid one; oh! the strong and mighty hero&mdash;who is he?... Is
he god, or Yaksha, or Gandharva?&#8221; But they
spoke not a word, for they were made bashfully silent by
reason of his beauty.</p>

<p>Nala smiled upon Damayantí, and first she smiled
softly in return; then she exclaimed in her wonder: &#8220;Who
art thou that hast come hither like a celestial being to
awaken all my love. Speak and tell, O sinless lord.
How didst thou contrive to enter the palace unseen, for
surely all the chambers are strongly guarded by stern
orders of the king?&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>The rajah made answer, saying:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span> &#8220;O thou fairest one,
know now that I am even Nala, and that I come hither as
the messenger of the gods Indra and Agni, Varuna and
Yama, and through their power have I entered here, unseen
nor stayed, for it is their desire that I should say
unto thee: &#8216;<i>Choose, O princess, for thine husband one of the
celestial beings</i>&#8217;. Such is the purpose of my mission from
the great world guardians. Having heard me, thou
mayst decide as thou wilt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Damayanti at once did homage to the gods. Then
she smiled upon Nala and spoke, saying: &#8220;Lo! I am
thine already, and whatsoever I possess is thine also.
O give me thy love in return, Nala. For know that
my heart's love was increased by the endearing words
of the swan, and it is because of thee that the rajahs are all
gathered here now. If thou wilt despise me, I will suffer
death for thy sake by fire, or by water, or even by the
noose<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The rajah made answer and said: &#8220;Wilt thou despise
these, the gods, and choose for thine husband a mortal
who is more lowly than the dust they walk upon? Let
thy heart aspire to them. Remember, too, that the man
who incurs the anger of the world's dread guardians will
meet with certain death. From such a fate oh shield
me, thou fairest one!... So choose one of the perfect
gods, and thou shalt have robes unsullied by dust,
garlands that never fade, and celestial joy without
end.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trembling, and with tear-dimmed eyes, Damayantí
said: &#8220;I do homage with due humility to all the gods,
but oh! I desire thee for my husband, thee and thee
only.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Nala spake, saying:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span> &#8220;I am charged with the
mission of the celestial beings, and cannot plead for
myself now. But afterwards I will come to claim thee,
and will speak boldly, O bright one, so remember me
in thine heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>The maiden smiled through her tears. &#8220;Ah!&#8221; she
said, &#8220;I see now a way of escape.... When thou
comest to the swayamvara, enter thou together with the
gods, and I will name thee as mine own, so that no sin
may be charged against thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Nala returned to the gods, who waited him
eagerly, and he told them all that the maiden had said,
word for word. &#8220;In thy wisdom,&#8221; he added, &#8220;thou
wilt judge of what remains, O ye excelling gods.&#8221;</p>

<p>When at length the day of happy omen, the day of
the swayamvara, arrived, Bhima summoned at noontide
all the love-sick rajahs, and they passed through the
court of golden columns and under the bright portal
arch, and entered the Hall of State like to lions on the
mountains. The rajahs were then seated on their thrones,
adorned with garlands and with dangling ear gems. The
arms of some were robust and powerful like the battle
mace; those of others were delicate and smooth as a
serpent. With profuse and flowing hair, shapely noses,
and arching eyebrows, the faces of these great lords were
radiant as the stars in heaven. As a mountain cave is
full of tigers, so was Bhima's great Hall full of rajah
tigers on that day.</p>

<p>When Damayantí entered in state, every eye and
every soul was entranced by her dazzling beauty; all
these lords of earth gazed upon her with unmoving eyes....
The name of each rajah was proclaimed in turn,
and Nala, looking about her, was suddenly stricken with
dismay, for she perceived that there were present five
Nalas who were undistinguishable in form and attire one
from another. The four gods who desired to win her
had each assumed the likeness of her beloved one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
Whichsoever of these she gazed upon, he seemed to be
her rajah, and in her secret heart she wailed: &#8220;How
can I discern Nala among the celestial beings?&#8221;</p>

<p>In her sore distress the trembling maiden folded her
hands and did homage before the gods, to whom she
prayed, saying:</p>

<p class="blockindent-full">&#8220;When I heard the sweet words of the swans,
I pledged my heart to Nala. I adjure thee by this
truth, O ye gods. Oh! reveal my lord.</p>

<p class="blockindent-full">&#8220;From my faith I have never swerved either by
word or by deed. I adjure thee by this truth, O
ye all-knowing Powers. Oh! reveal my lord.</p>

<p class="blockindent-full">&#8220;The gods have destined that Nala should be
mine husband. I adjure thee by this truth. Oh!
reveal my lord.</p>

<p class="blockindent-full">&#8220;The vow which I so pledged to Nala is holy,
and I must ever keep it. I adjure thee by this
truth. Oh! reveal my lord.</p>

<p class="blockindent-full">&#8220;O ye mighty ones, ye guardians of the world,
assume now your forms divine, so that I may know
Nala, the monarch of men.&#8221;</p>

<p>The gods heard the sad maiden's piteous prayer and
marvelled greatly. They perceived that her resolve was
firm, that she was constant in truth and in love, and
was holy and wise, and that she remained faithful to her
lord. So they revealed the tokens of their greatness....<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>
Then Damayantí was able to discern the four
celestial beings because their skins were without moisture
and their eyes never winked, there was no dust on
their garlands and their feet did not touch the earth.
She also knew Nala because he cast a shadow; there
was dust on his raiment, and his garland was beginning
to fade; drops of moisture stood on his skin, and his
eyelids moved.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>

<p>Gazing first upon the celestial beings and then upon
him who was her heart's desire, Damayantí named Nala
as her lord. She modestly touched the hem of his
garment and threw round his neck a wreath of bright
flowers, and thus chose him for her husband.</p>

<p>All the rivals of Nala uttered cries of sorrow, but
the gods and the sages exclaimed aloud: &#8220;Well done!
Well done!&#8221; and honoured the lord of Nishadha.</p>

<p>Nala spake in his joy to fair Damayantí, saying:
&#8220;Since thou, O maiden with serene smile, hast chosen
me for thine husband in the presence of the gods, know
that I will be a faithful consort who will ever take
delight in thy words. I am thine, and so long as my
life endures I will be thine only.&#8221;</p>

<p>So did the lord of Nishadha pledge his faith, and
the heart of the maiden was made glad. The happy
pair then did homage before the gods, and these resplendent
guardians of the earth bestowed, in their joy,
eight surpassing gifts upon Nala. Indra gave him power
to behold the godhead in the sacrifice, and power to
walk unhindered by any obstacle wheresoever he desired;
Agni gave him power over fire, and power over the three
worlds;<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> Varuna gave him power over water, and power
to obtain fresh garlands at will; and Yama gave him
subtle skill in preparing food, and eminence in every
virtue. Each of the gods also conferred his double
blessing upon Nala, and thereafter they departed.</p>

<p>All the rajahs wondered greatly when they beheld
the maiden's choice confirmed in this manner, and they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>went away as they came, with joy, and returned unto their
own domains.</p>

<p>Bhima rejoiced greatly when the happy bridal was
celebrated in pomp and with state, and he bade Nala
adieu with great courtesy when that great lord of Nishadha,
after fitting sojourn at Vidarbha, set out to return
to his native city with the pearl of women whom he had
won.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that when the gods had left the
swayamvara they met in the midst of the blue air Kali<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>,
the demon of evil, who was accompanied by the wicked
spirit Dwápara. Indra, the slayer of giants, spoke and
said: &#8220;Whither art thou going with Dwápara, O Kali?&#8221;</p>

<p>Kali made answer: &#8220;We are hastening to the swayamvara,
for it is my desire to obtain Damayantí as my
bride.&#8221;</p>

<p>Smiling, the king of gods spake, saying: &#8220;The bridal
is now arranged and ended, for lo! the fair Damayantí
has chosen Nala for her husband in our presence.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he heard these words, the heart of Kali was
made angry, and he exclaimed: &#8220;Since she has preferred
a mortal in presence of the celestial beings, let her choice
be her own doom.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the gods said: &#8220;Know thou that our consent was
freely given, because Damayantí has chosen for herself a
husband endowed with all the virtues, and equal even to
the guardians of the world. If anyone should chance to
curse Nala, the curse will recoil fatally, and the curser
will be cast into the torments of the dark lake of hell.&#8221;
Having spoken thus, the bright deities ascended the
heavens.</p>

<p>Then said Kali to Dwapara:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span> &#8220;I cannot now control
my fierce wrath. Lo! I will be avenged upon Nala, for
I will enter his body, and he will be bereft of his kingdom
and of his bride. Thou, Dwapara, wilt enter the
dice and give me thine aid.&#8221;</p>

<p>So was a malignant compact arranged between the
demon of evil and his darksome ally, and together they
went towards Nishadha to haunt the stately palace of
Nala, waiting for the fatal moment.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI_Wanderings_in_the_Forest" id="CHAPTER_XXI_Wanderings_in_the_Forest">CHAPTER XXI<br />Wanderings in the Forest</a></h2>

<p class="blockcontents">Nala Possessed by a Demon&mdash;A Brother's Challenge&mdash;The Game of

<p>For twelve bright years Nala and Damayantí lived happily
together. The great rajah ruled his people justly; he
offered up every sacrifice to the gods, and he gave sumptuous
gifts to holy men. Fair Damayantí became the
mother of a beauteous daughter, who was named Indrasena,
and of a comely son, who was named Indrasen. So
were the blessings of life showered upon the blissful pair.</p>

<p>But at length there came a day when, after performing
an unclean act, Nala sipped holy water and went to
prayer with unwashed feet.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> The watchful Kali seized
this fatal opportunity, and straightway entered the rajah
and possessed his inmost soul. Then that evil demon
summoned Push´kara, the brother of Nala, saying: &#8220;Come
now and throw dice with the king. I will give thee mine
aid, so that thou wilt be enabled to win the whole realm
for thyself.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span></p>

<p>Pushkara at once challenged his brother, whereupon
the wicked spirit Dwapara entered the dice.</p>

<p>Nala gave ready consent to take part in the game
of hazard, for he was swayed by evil Kali. Then the
two rivals began to play together in the presence of
Damayantí.</p>

<p>The great rajah staked his wealth, and he was worsted;
he staked his golden treasures and he staked his chariots,
and still he was worsted; he staked his rich attire, and he
continued to lose. The passion for dice had possessed
Nala like to sudden madness, and it was in vain that his
friends endeavoured to restrain him.</p>

<p>In time rumours of dire happenings went abroad
through the city, whereupon the rajah's faithful subjects,
accompanied by high counsellors of state, assembled at
the palace gate with desire to prevail upon him to cease
playing. They urged upon Damayantí to intervene, and
the spirit-broken daughter of Bhima approached Nala in
anguish and in dismay, and with tear-choking voice she
spoke to him, saying: &#8220;All thy subjects are gathered
without, for they cannot endure the thought that misfortune
should fall upon thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nala heard her, but answered not a word, because his
soul was clouded by evil Kali. Then the wise men said:
&#8220;It is not he;&#8221; and they departed to their homes in
sorrow and in shame....</p>

<p>So the play went on; daily it went on through many
weary months, and Nala was always worsted.</p>

<p>When, in the end, Damayantí perceived that all the
treasures were lost, she sent for the faithful charioteer,
Várshneya, and spoke to him, saying:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span> &#8220;Hasten now and
yoke Nala's speedy and much-loved steeds, and place my
children in the chariot. Then drive quickly to the city
of my kindred and leave them in care of my father, the
Rajah Bhima. When thou hast done me that service,
O Varshneya, thou mayst go wheresoever thou
wilt.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the charioteer conveyed the beauteous girl Indrasena
and the comely boy Indrasen to the city of Vidarbha,
and he delivered them safely unto Bhima, whom he informed
fully regarding the fall of Nala. Thereafter he
departed, sorrowing greatly, and went to the city of
Ayodhyá,<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> where he took service with the renowned
Rajah Rituparna.</p>

<p>Nala played on; he continued to throw the dice, until
at length he had lost all his possessions. Then Pushkara
smiled and spoke to his stricken brother, saying: &#8220;Now,
throw but one more hazard. Where is your stake? Ah!
you have naught left now save Damayantí. Let us throw
the dice for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>At these words Nala's heart was rent in twain. Mute
with sorrow, he gazed upon his brother.... He arose
and stripped off his rich vestments one by one in the
presence of his lamenting friends. Then slowly and in
silence he went forth, naked and alone. Damayantí,
wearing but a single garment, followed him behind.
Together they stood at the city gates.</p>

<p>Then Pushkara, who had become rajah, caused to be
proclaimed throughout the city the dread decree: &#8220;<i>Whosoever
giveth food or drink unto Nala shall be immediately put
to death</i>&#8221;.</p>

<p>In their terror the people could not give further help
to the fallen king, and for three days and three nights
he drank water only. Then he plucked wild fruit and
roots from the earth, and these he ate. Nala thereafter
wandered away from Nishadha, an outcast among men,
and Damayantí followed him behind.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span></p>
<p>Tortured by hunger, the fallen king at length beheld
on the ground a flock of birds with gold-flecked wings,
and he said in his heart: &#8220;Now I will make me a welcome
feast.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he crept forward and flung over them his single
garment; but they rose in the air, carrying it away with
them. As they went they cried out mockingly in human
language and said: &#8220;Know now, O foolish king, that
we are the dice. We came hither on purpose to despoil
thee utterly, for so long as thou hadst left a single garment
our joy was incomplete.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereupon Nala spoke to Damayantí in his anguish,
saying: &#8220;O blameless one, by whose anger have I been
driven from my kingdom and rendered thus unable to
procure any food? Listen now to my counsel. The
roads diverge here before us, and one leads southward
past the caves of holy hermits, which are stored with
food, towards the kingdom of thy royal sire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anxiously did Nala point out the way and urge upon
Bhima's fair daughter to take refuge in Vidarbha ere he
would enter the great forest.</p>

<p>Weighed down by her heavy sorrow, Damayantí made
answer with tear-choking voice: &#8220;Alas! thy words of
counsel cause my heart to break and my limbs to fail me.
How can I leave thee all alone in trackless forest when
thou hast lost thy kingdom and thy riches, and whilst
thou art athirst and tortured by hunger? Rather let me
comfort thee, O my husband, when in thy grief, and,
famine-stricken as thou now art, thou dost ponder wearily
over thy lost happiness, for in truth have wise physicians
said that a wife is the only balsam and the only healing
herb for her husband's sorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Nala:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span> &#8220;Thou hast spoken truly. There is
indeed no medicine for a stricken man like to his wife's
love. Think not that I desire to part from thee....
Would that I could abandon myself!&#8221;</p>

<p>Damayantí wept and said: &#8220;If thou wouldst not
leave me, why, O king, dost thou make heavier my
sorrow by pointing out the way to Vidarbha? Thou art
too noble to abandon me, yet thou dost show me the
road southward. If it is meet that I should return unto
my father, come thou with me and he will bid thee welcome,
and we could dwell together happily in his palace.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nala made answer sadly: &#8220;Ah! never can I return
in my shame to that city where I have appeared aforetime
in pride and in splendour.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, comforting Damayantí, Nala wandered on with
her through the deep forest, and they made one garment
serve them both. Greatly they suffered from hunger and
from thirst, and when at length they came to a lonely
hut, they sat down on the hard ground, nor had they
even a mat to rest upon. Damayantí was overcome with
weariness, and soon she sank asleep; she lay all naked
on that bare floor. But there was no rest for Nala; he
thought with pain of his lost kingdom and the friends
who had deserted him, and of the weary journey he must
make in the midst of the great forest. &#8220;Ah! were it
better to die now and end all,&#8221; he mused, &#8220;or to desert
her whom I love? She is devoted unto me more deeply
than I deserve. Perchance if she were abandoned she
would return to Vidarbha. She is unable to endure my
sufferings and the constant sorrow which must be mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Long he pondered thus, until Kali swayed him to
desert his faithful wife. So he severed her garment and
used half of it. He turned away from the fair princess
as she lay fast asleep.</p>

<p>Repenting in his heart, Nala returned speedily and
gazed upon fair Damayantí with pity and with love. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
wept bitterly, saying: &#8220;Ah! thou dost sleep on the bare
hard ground whom neither sun nor storm hath ever used
roughly. O my loved one, thou hast ever awakened to
smile. How wilt thou fare when thou dost discover that
thy lord hath abandoned thee in the midst of the perilous
forest?... May sun and wind and the spirits of the
wood protect thee, and may thou be shielded ever by
thine own great virtue!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the distracted rajah, prompted by Kali again,
hastened away; but his heart was torn by his love, which
drew him back.... So time and again he came and
went, like to a swing, backward and forward, until in the
end the evil spirit conquered him, and he departed from
Damayantí, who moaned fitfully in her sleep; and he
plunged into the depths of the forest.</p>

<p>Ere long the fair princess awoke, and when she perceived
that she was all alone she uttered a piteous scream
and cried out: &#8220;Oh! where art thou, my king, my lord,
my sole protector?... I am lost; oh! I am undone.
I am helpless and alone in the perilous wood.... Ah!
now thou art but deceiving me. Do not mock me, my
lord. Art thou hidden there among the bushes? Oh,
speak!... Why dost thou not make answer?... I do
not sorrow for myself only. I cannot well endure that
thou shouldst be alone, that thou shouldst thirst and be
anhungered and very weary, and without me to give thee
comfort....&#8221;</p>

<p>So she wailed as she searched through the forest for
Nala, now casting herself upon the ground, now sitting
to pine in silence, and anon crying out in her grief. At
length she said: &#8220;Oh, may he who causeth Nala to suffer
endure even greater agony than he endureth, and may he
live for ever in darkness and in misery!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hither and thither she wandered, seeking her lord,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
and ever was she heard crying: &#8220;Alas! O alas! my
husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly a great serpent rose up in its wrath and
coiled itself round her fair body....</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! my guardian,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;I am now undone.
The serpent hath seized me. Why art thou not near?...
Ah! who will comfort thee now in thy sorrow, O
blameless Nala?&#8221;</p>

<p>As she lamented thus, a passing huntsman heard her
cries; he broke through the jungle and beheld Damayantí
in the coils of the serpent.... Nimbly he darted
forward and with a single blow smote off the monster's
head, and thus rescued the beauteous lady from her
awesome peril. Then he washed her body and gave her
food, and she was refreshed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who art thou, O fair-eyed one?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Why
dost thou wander thus alone in the perilous wood?&#8221;</p>

<p>Damayantí of faultless form thereupon related to the
huntsman the story of her sorrow. As she spoke, his
frail heart was moved by her great beauty, and he uttered
amorous words with whining voice.... Perceiving his
evil intent, she was roused to fierce anger. Her chastity
was her sole defence, and she cursed him so that he
immediately fell down dead like to a tree that has been
smitten by lightning and is suddenly blasted.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>Freed thus from the savage huntsman of wild beasts,
the lotus-eyed Damayantí wandered on through the deep
forest, which resounded everywhere with the song of the
cricket. All around her were trees of every form and
name, and she beheld shady arbours, deep valleys, and
wooded hill summits, and lakes and pools, loud resounding
waterfalls, and great flowing rivers. The forest was
drear and appalling: it was full of lions and tigers, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>countless birds and fierce robbers. She saw buffaloes and
wild boars feeding, and the fierce and awesome forms that
were there also&mdash;serpents and giants and terrible demons....
But, protected by her virtue, she wandered on all
alone without fear. Her sole anxiety was for Nala, and
she wept for him, crying: &#8220;Ah! where art thou? O
blameless one, remember now thy vows and thy plighted
faith. Remember the words which the gold-winged swan
addressed unto thee.... Am I not thy loved one?...
Oh! why dost thou not make answer in this dark and
perilous forest? The savage beasts are gaping to devour
me. Why art thou not near to save?... I am weak and
pallid and dust-stained, and have need of thee, my protector....
Whom can I ask for Nala? The tiger is
before me, the king of the forest, and I am not afraid.
I address him, saying: &#8216;Oh! I am lonely, and wretched,
and sorrowful, seeking for my exiled husband. If thou
hast seen him, console me; if thou hast not seen him,
devour me, and set me free from this misery.&#8217; ... But
the tiger turns down to the river bank, and I wander
onward towards the holy mountain, the monarch of hills.</p>

<p>&#8220;'Hear me!' I cry. I salute thee, O Mountain....
I am a king's daughter and the consort of a king,
the illustrious lord of Nishadha, the pious, the faultless
one, who is courageous as the elephant.... Hast thou
seen my Nala, O mighty Mountain?... Ah! why
dost thou not answer me?... Comfort thou me now
as if I were thine own child.... Oh! shall I ever behold
him again, and ever hear again his honey-sweet
voice, like music, saying: &#8216;Daughter of Vidarbha,&#8217; while
it doth soothe all my pain with its blessed sound?...&#8221;</p>

<p>Having thus addressed the mountain, Damayantí
turned northward and wandered on for three days and
three nights. Then she reached a holy grove, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
entered it humbly and without fear. She beheld there
the cells of hermits and their bright sacred fires. The
holy men were struck with wonder by reason of her
beauty, and they bade her welcome, saying: &#8220;Art thou
a goddess of the wood, or of the mountain, or of the river?
O speak and tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Damayantí made answer: &#8220;I am not a goddess of the
wood, or a mountain spirit, or yet a river nymph, but a
mortal woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she related to the holy men the story of her
sorrow and her wandering, and these seers spoke to her
and said: &#8220;A time cometh soon, a time of beauty, when
thou wilt again behold Nala in splendour and sin-released
ruling over his people.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they had spoken thus, all the holy men
vanished, and their sacred fires vanished also. Damayantí
stood a while in silent wonder, and in her heart she
said: &#8220;Have I seen a vision?...&#8221; Then she went
towards another region.</p>

<p>Lamenting for Nala, the fair one came to a beauteous
asoka tree<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>: its green branches were gemmed with
gleaming fruit, and were melodious with the songs of
birds. &#8220;O happy tree,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;take away all my
grief.... Say, hast thou beheld my Nala, the slayer of
his enemies, my beloved lord? Oh! hast thou seen my
one love, with smooth, bright skin, wandering alone in
the forest? Answer me, O blessed Asoka, so that I may
depart from thee in joy. Ah! hear and speak thou happy
tree....&#8221;</p>

<p>So, wailing in her deep anguish, Damayantí moved
round the asoka. Then she went towards a lonelier and
more fearsome region.... She passed many a river and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>many mountains, and she saw numerous birds and deer
as she wandered on and on, searching for her lost
lord.</p>

<p>At length she beheld a great caravan of merchants.
Ponderous elephants and eager camels, prancing horses
and rumbling cars came through a river. The river banks
were fringed by cane and tangled undergrowth; the curlew
called aloud there, and the osprey; red geese were
clamouring; turtles were numerous, as were the fish and
the serpents likewise. All the noble animals of the
caravan came splashing noisily across the ford.</p>

<p>The great concourse of travellers stared with wonder
on the slender-waisted, maniac-like woman, clad in but
half a garment, smeared with dust and pale and sorrowful,
her long hair all matted and miry. Some there were who
fled from her in fear. But others took pity and said:
&#8220;Who art thou, O lady, and what seekest thou in the
lonely forest? Art thou a goddess of the mountain, or
of the forest, or of the plain?... We pray for thy protection;
be mindful of our welfare so that we may prosper
upon our journey.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Damayantí told the story of her misfortune and
sorrow, and all the travellers gathered round about to
hear&mdash;boys and young men and grey-haired sages.
&#8220;Oh! have you beheld my lord, my Nala?&#8221; she cried
unto them.</p>

<p>The captain of the band answered her &#8220;Nay&#8221;; and
she asked him whither the caravan was bound, whereat
he said: &#8220;We are going towards the realm of Chedi, over
which Subáhu is king.&#8221; When the merchants resumed
their journey, Damayantí went with them.</p>

<p>Through the forest they travelled a long distance,
and at eventide they reached the green shore of a
beautiful wide lake which sparkled with bright lotus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
blooms.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> The camp was pitched in the middle of a deep
grove. Gladly did the men bathe with their wearied
animals in the delicious, ice-cool waters.</p>

<p>At midnight all slept.... In the deep silence a herd
of wild forest elephants, with moisture oozing from their
temples,<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> came down to drink from the gurgling stream
which flowed nigh to the camp. When they scented the
tame elephants lying crouched in slumber, they trumpeted
aloud, and of a sudden charged ponderously and fell upon
them like to mountain peaks tumbling into the valleys
beneath.... Trees and tents were thrown down as they
trampled through the camping ground, and the travellers
awoke panic-stricken, crying: &#8220;Oh! Alas! Ah! Oh!&#8221;
Some fled through the forest; others, blind with sleep,
stood gasping with wonder, and the elephants slew them.
The camp was scattered in the dire confusion; many
animals were gored; men overthrew one another, endeavouring
to escape; many shrieked in terror, and a
few climbed trees. Voices were heard calling: &#8220;It is
a fire!&#8221; and merchants screamed, &#8220;Why fly away so
speedily? Save the precious jewels, O ye cowards.&#8221;</p>

<p>Amidst the tumult and the slaughter Damayantí
awoke, trembling with fear, and she made swift escape,
nor suffered a wound. In the deep forest she came nigh
to the few men who had found refuge, and she heard
them say one to another:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;What deed have we done to bring this misfortune
upon us? Have we forgotten to adore Manibhadra<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>, the
high king of the Yakshas? Worshipped we not, ere we
set forth, the dread spirits which bring disasters? Was
it doomed that all omens should be belied? How hath
it come that such a disaster hath befallen us?&#8221;</p>

<p>Others who had been bereft of their kindred and their
wealth, and were in misery, said: &#8220;Who was she&mdash;that
ill-omened, maniac-eyed woman who came amongst us?
In truth she seemed scarcely human. Surely it is by
reason of her evil power that disaster hath befallen us.
Ah! she is a witch, or she is a sorceress, or mayhap a
demon.... Without doubt she is the cause of all our
woes.... Would that we could find her&mdash;oh the evil
destroyer! Oh the curse of our host!... Let us slay
the murderess with clods and with stones, with canes and
with staves, or else with our fists....&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>When the terrified and innocent Damayantí heard
these fearsome threats, she fled away through the trees,
lamenting her fate, and wailing: &#8220;Alas! alas! my terrible
doom doth haunt me still. Misfortune dogs my footsteps....
I have no memory of any sin of thought or
deed&mdash;of any wrong done by me to living beings. Perchance,
oh, alas! I did sin in my former life, and am now
suffering due punishment.... For I suffer, indeed. I
have lost my husband; my kingdom is lost; I have lost
my kindred; my noble Nala has been taken from me,
and I am far removed from my children, and I wander
alone in the wood of serpents.&#8221;</p>

<p>When morning broke, the sorrowful queen met with
some holy Brahmans who had escaped the night's disaster,
and she went with them towards the city of Chedi.</p>

<p>The people gazed with wonder on Damayantí when
she walked though the streets with her dust-smeared body
and matted hair. The children danced about her as she
wandered about like to a maniac, so miserable and weary
and emaciated.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></p>
<p>It chanced that the sorrowing woman came nigh to
the royal palace. The mother of the king looked forth
from a window, and beheld her and said: &#8220;Hasten, and
bid this poor wanderer to enter. Although stricken and
half-clothed she hath, methinks, the beauty of Indra's
long-eyed queen. Let her have refuge from those staring
men.&#8221;</p>

<p>Damayantí was then led before the queen mother, who
spoke gently, saying: &#8220;Although bowed down with grief,
thou art beautiful of form. Thou fearest not anyone.
Who art thou so well protected by thine own chastity?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bhima's daughter wept, lamenting her fate, and related
all that had befallen her, but did not reveal who she was.
Then the queen mother said: &#8220;Dwell thou here with me,
and our servants shall go in quest of thy husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>Damayantí said: &#8220;O mother of heroes, if I abide here
with thee I must eat not of food remnants, nor do menial
service, nor can I hold converse with any man save the
holy Brahmans who promise to search for my husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>The royal lady made answer: &#8220;As thou desireth, so
let it be.&#8221; Then she spake to Sunanda, her daughter,
saying: &#8220;This lady will be to thee a handmaiden and a
friend. She is of thine own age and thy worthy peer.
Be happy together.&#8221;</p>

<p>At these words the Princess Sunanda was made glad,
and she led the strange woman unto her own abode,
where sat all her virgin handmaidens.</p>

<p>There Damayantí dwelt for a time, waiting for her
lost husband.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII_Nala_in_Exile" id="CHAPTER_XXII_Nala_in_Exile">CHAPTER XXII<br />Nala in Exile</a></h2>

<p>Soon after Nala had fled into the forest depths, deserting
the faithful Damayantí, he beheld a great fire which blazed
furiously. As he drew nigh he heard a voice crying over
and over again from the midst of the sacred flames:
&#8220;Hasten, Nala! Oh, hasten, Nala, and come hither!&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, Agni had given Nala power over fire, so crying:
&#8220;Have no fear,&#8221; he leapt through the flames.... In
the space within that blazing circle be beheld the king of
serpents lying coiled up in a ring with folded hands and
unable to move.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> &#8220;Lo! I am Karkotaka,&#8221; the serpent said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
&#8220;and am suffering this punishment because that I deceived
the holy sage Nárada, who thereupon cursed me, saying:
&#8216;Thou wilt remain here in the midst of the flames until
Nala cometh nigh to free thee from my curse&#8217;.... So
do I lie without power to move. O mighty rajah, if thou
wilt rescue me even now, I will reward thee abundantly
with my noble friendship, and help thee to attain great
happiness. Oh lift me all speedily from out of this fiery
place, thou noble rajah!&#8221;</p>

<p>When he had spoken thus, Karkotaka, king of the
serpents, shrank to the size of a man's finger, whereupon
Nala uplifted and carried him safely through the flames to
a cool and refreshing space without.</p>

<p>The serpent then said: &#8220;Now walk on and count thy
steps, so that good fortune may be assured to thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nala walked nine steps, but ere he could take the
tenth the serpent bit him, whereat the rajah was suddenly
transformed into a misshapen dwarf with short arms.</p>

<p>Then Karkotaka said: &#8220;Know now that I have thus
changed thy form so that no man may know thee. My
poison, too, will cause unceasing anguish to the evil one
who possesseth thy soul; he will suffer greatly until he
shall set thee free from thy sorrow. So wilt thou be
delivered from thine enemy, O blameless one.... My
poison will harm thee not, and henceforth, by reason of
my power, thou wilt have no need to fear the wild boar,
or any foeman, or a Brahman, or the sages. Ever in
battle thou wilt be victorious.... Now, go thy way,
and be called &#8216;Váhuka, the charioteer&#8217;. Hasten thou
unto the city of Ayodhya<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> and enter the service of the
royal Rajah Rituparna, the skilful in dice. Thou wilt
teach him how to subdue horses, and he will impart
to thee the secret of dice. Then wilt thou again have
joy. Sorrow not, therefore, for thy wife and thy children
will be restored unto thee, and thou wilt regain thy kingdom.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the serpent gave unto Nala a magic robe, saying:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
&#8220;When it is thy desire to be as thou wert, O king, think
of me and put on this garment, and thou wilt immediately
resume thy wonted form.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having spoken thus, the king of serpents vanished
from sight. Thereupon Nala went towards the city of
Ayodhyá, and he stood in the presence of the royal Rajah
Rituparna, unto whom he spoke thus: &#8220;My name is
Váhuká. I am a tamer of steeds, nor is my equal to be
found in the world; and I have surpassing skill in cooking
viands.&#8221;</p>

<p>The rajah welcomed him and took him into his service,
saying: &#8220;Thou shalt cause my horses to be fleet of foot.
Be thou master of mine own steed, and thy reward will
be great.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was well pleased and gave unto Váhuka for comrades
Várshneya, who had been in Nala's service, and
Jívala also. So the transformed rajah abode a long time
at Ayodhya, and every evening, sitting alone, he sang a
single verse:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Where is she all worn but faithful, weary, thirsty, hung'ring too?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thinks she of her foolish husband?... Doth another man her woo?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Ever thus he sang, and his comrades heard him and
wondered greatly. So it came that one evening Jívala
spoke to Nala and said: &#8220;For whom do you sorrow
thus, O Váhuka? I pray you to tell me. Who is the
husband of this lady?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nala answered him with sad voice and said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span> &#8220;Once
there was a peerless lady, and she had a husband of
weakly will. And lo! as they wandered in a forest
together, he fled from her without cause, and yet he
sorrowed greatly. Ever by day and by night is he
consumed by his overwhelming grief, and brooding
ever, he sings this melancholy song. He is a weary
wanderer in the wide world, and his sorrow is without
end; it is never still.... His wife wanders all forlorn in
the forest. Ah! she deserved not such a fate. Thirsting
and anhungered she wanders alone because her lord forsook
her and fled; wild beasts are about her, seeking to
devour; the wood is full of perils.... It may be that she
is not now alive....&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus did Nala sorrow in his secret heart over Damayantí
during his long sojourn at Ayodhya, while he served
the renowned Rajah Rituparna.</p>

<p>Meanwhile King Bhima was causing search to be made
for his lost daughter and her royal husband. Abundant
rewards were offered to Bráhmans, who went through every
kingdom and every city in quest of the missing pair. It
chanced that a Brahman, named Sudeva, entered Chedi
when a royal holiday was being celebrated, and he beheld
Damayantí standing beside the Princess Sunanda and the
queen mother at the royal palace.</p>

<p>Sudeva perceived that her loveliness had been dimmed
by sorrow, and to himself he said as he gazed upon her:
&#8220;Ah! the lady with lotus eyes is like to the moon, darkly
beautiful; her splendour hath shrunken like the crescent
moon veiled in cloud&mdash;she who aforetime was beheld in
the full moonlight of her glory. Pining for her lost
husband, she is like to a darksome night when the moon
is swallowed; her sorrow hath stricken her like to a river
which has become dry, like to a shrunken pool in which
lotus blooms shrivel and fade; she is, indeed, like to
withered lotus.... Doth Nala live now without the
bride who thus mourns for him?... When, oh when
shall Damayantí be restored once again unto her lord as
the moon bride is restored unto the peerless moon?<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> ...
Methinks I will speak....&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>

<p>The Brahman then approached Damayantí and said:
&#8220;I am Sudeva. Thy royal sire and thy mother and thy
children are well.... A hundred Brahmans have been
sent forth throughout the world to search for thee, O
noble lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>Damayantí heard him and wept.</p>

<p>The Princess Sunanda spoke to her queen mother,
saying: &#8220;Lo! our handmaid weeps because that the
Brahman hath spoken unto her.... Who she is we
shall speedily know now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the queen mother conducted the holy man to
her chambers and spoke to him, saying: &#8220;Who is she&mdash;this
mysterious and noble stranger, O holy man?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sudeva spoke in answer: &#8220;Her name is Damayantí,
and her sire is King Bhima, lord of Vidarbha. Her
husband is Nala.... From birth she has had a dark
beauty spot like to a lotus between her fair eyebrows.
Although it is covered with dust, I perceived it, and
so I knew her. By Brahma was this spot made as
the sign of his beauty-creating power.&#8221;</p>

<p>The queen mother bade Sudeva to remove the dust
from the beauty spot of Bhima's daughter. When this
was done, it came forth like to the unclouded moon in
heaven, and the royal lady and her daughter wept together
and embraced the fair Damayantí<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>.</p>

<p>Then the queen mother said: &#8220;Lo! thou art mine
own sister's daughter, O beauteous one. Our sire is
the Rajah Sudáman who reigns at Dasárna<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>.... Once
I beheld thee as a child.... Ah! ask of me whatsoever
thou desirest and it shall be thine.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Alas! I am a banished mother,&#8221; Damayantí said
with fast-flowing tears. &#8220;Permit me, therefore, to return
unto my children who have been orphaned of mother and
sire.&#8221;</p>

<p>The queen mother said: &#8220;Be it so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Damayantí was given an army to guard her on
her journey towards her native city, and she was welcomed
there by all her kindred and friends with great rejoicing.
King Bhima rewarded Sudeva with a thousand kine, and
a town's revenue for a village.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p>When Damayantí was embraced by her mother she
said: &#8220;Now our chief duty is to bring home Nala.&#8221;</p>

<p>The queen wept, and spoke to her husband, the royal
Bhima, saying: &#8220;Our daughter still mourns heavily for
lost lord and cannot be comforted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Bhima urged the Brahmans to search for Nala,
offering munificent reward when that he should be found.
Damayantí addressed these holy men ere they departed
and said unto them:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span> &#8220;Wheresoever thou goest, speak this
my message over and over again:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<i>Whither art thou gone, O gambler, who didst sever my
garment in twain? Thou didst leave thy loved one as she lay
slumbering in the savage wood. Lo! she is awaiting thy
return: by day and by night she sitteth alone, consumed by
her grief. Oh hear her prayer and have compassion, thou
noble hero, because that she ever weepeth for thee in the
depths of her despair!</i>&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>So the holy men went through every kingdom and
every city repeating the message of Damayantí over and
over again; but when they began to return one by one,
each told with sadness that his quest had been in vain.</p>

<p>Then came unto Vidarbha that Brahman, the wise
Parnada, who had sojourned a time in the city of Ayodhya.
He addressed the daughter of Bhima, saying: &#8220;Unto
Rituparna I spake regarding thy husband, repeating thy
message, but he answered not a word. So I went out
from before him. Thereafter there came to me his
charioteer, a man with short arms and misshapen body.
His name is Váhuka, and he is skilled in driving the swift
chariot and in preparing viands. He sorrowed greatly,
and with melancholy voice spoke unto me these words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8216;<i>In the excess of her sorrow a noble woman will compose
herself and remain constant, and so win heaven by her virtues.
She is protected by the breastplate of her chastity, and will suffer
no harm. Nor will she yield to anger although she be deserted
by her lord, whose robe the birds have taken away, leaving
him in sore distress. She will not be moved to wrath against
her husband, the sorrow-stricken and famine-wasted, who hath
been bereft of his kingdom and despoiled of happiness.</i>&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>When I heard the stranger's speech I came speedily
hither to repeat it unto thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Damayantí at once went and spoke to her mother
privately, for she was assured that Vahuka, the charioteer,
was her royal lord. Then she gave of her wealth to the
Brahman, saying: &#8220;Thou wilt get more if Nala returns
home.&#8221; The wise Parnada was weary with travel, and
he departed to his own village.</p>

<p>Neither Damayantí nor her mother made known unto
King Bhima their discovery nor yet their immediate purpose.
Secretly the wife of Nala spake to Sudeva and said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
&#8220;Hasten thou unto the city of Ayodhya, and appear before
the Rajah Rituparna as if thou hadst come by chance, and
say unto him: &#8216;<i>Once again is the daughter of Bhima to hold
her swayamvara. All the kings and all the sons of kings are
hastening as aforetime to Vidarbha. To-morrow at dawn she
will choose for herself a new lord, for no one knoweth whether
Nala liveth or not.</i>&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>So Sudeva went unto Ayodhya and spake as Damayantí
desired of him, and then said: &#8220;If thou wouldst
win the princess, O Rituparna, thou must go swiftly, for
when the sun rises she will choose her a second husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rituparna at once sent for Vahuka, and said: &#8220;O
skilled charioteer, I must needs hasten to Vidarbha in
a single day, because that the fair Damayantí holdeth
her swayamvara at dawn to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>At these words the heart of Nala was torn with grief,
and he said unto himself: &#8220;Is this but a stratagem to
deceive me? Or is she whom I wronged estranged in
mind? Hath she grown fickle of heart, she who hath
been soul-stricken by grief in the depths of despair?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he spake unto Rituparna and said: &#8220;As thou
desirest so will I do, O Rituparna. I will drive thee in
a single day to Vidarbha.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having promised thus, he went forth and selected
four steeds of high courage with the ten good marks,<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>
which were as swift as the wind. He yoked them in
haste, spake to them soothingly, and then set forth with
Rituparna and Varshneya also at full speed. The rajah
sat in silent wonder as the chariot went swiftly, and to
himself he said: &#8220;Vahuka hath the god-like skill of the
charioteer of heaven.... Can he be Nala, who hath
taken himself another body? If he is not Nala, he is one
who hath equal skill. Great men are wandering at times
to and fro in disguise&mdash;gods who are hidden in human
form.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span></p>

<p>So the rajah marvelled and thought, while he rejoiced
in the matchless skill of the misshapen charioteer.</p>

<p>Swiftly they went. Over hills and rivers and over
forests and lakes the chariot glided like to a bird through
the air.... Of a sudden the rajah's robe was swept
away, and he cried to the charioteer, saying: &#8220;Stop at
instant, so that Varshneya may hasten back and recover
my garment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nala paused not, and said: &#8220;Thy robe is now five
miles behind us, and we cannot wait to recover it.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they went on with all speed. Ere long Rituparna
beheld a lofty fruit tree, named Vibhítak, and he said to
Vahuka: &#8220;Now, skilful charioteer, thou shalt perceive
my ability in numbers. No single mind is accomplished
in every kind of knowledge. On two branches of yonder
fruit tree are fifty million leaves and two thousand and
ninety-five berries.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vahuka said: &#8220;The leaves and the fruit are invisible
to me. But I will tear off a branch and count the berries
while Varshneya doth hold the bridle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; urged the rajah, &#8220;we cannot pause on our
journey.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vahuka said: &#8220;Thou mayst stay with me, or thou
canst let Varshneya drive thee at full speed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the rajah spoke soothingly, saying: &#8220;O matchless
charioteer! I cannot go on without thee to Vidarbha.
I trust in thee. If thou wilt promise that we will
reach the city ere night falls, I will do even as you
desire.&#8221;</p>

<p>The transformed Nala made answer: &#8220;I will indeed
make haste when I have counted the berries.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the horses were drawn up, and Nala tore a branch
from the tree. Having counted the berries, he found
they were in number even as the rajah had said, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
exclaimed: &#8220;Wonderful, indeed, is thy power, O Rituparna!
Fain would I know thy secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now the rajah was eager to proceed on his way, and
he said: &#8220;I know the secret of the dice, and am therefore
skilled in numbers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Nala, &#8220;if thou wilt impart to me thy
secret, I will give thee knowledge in steeds.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rituparna made answer thereat: &#8220;So be it;&#8221; and
he forthwith informed the charioteer in the science of
dice.</p>

<p>Now when Nala grew skilful in dice, Kali immediately
passed out of his body, and Nishadha's fallen king
vomited forth the serpent poison and was made weak
with the struggle. Released from the venom, Kali resumed
his wonted form, but he was beheld by Nala
alone, who sought to curse him.</p>

<p>In his terror, the evil demon folded his hands and
said: &#8220;Do not injure me, O king, and I will give thee
matchless fame.... Know thou that Damayantí cursed
me heavily in her wrath when thou didst desert her in
the forest, and I have ever since endured great agony.
Night and day, too, have I been scorched by the poison
of the king of serpents.... Now I seek thy pity. I
come to thee that thou mayst be my refuge. Lo! I
promise, if thou wilt not curse me, that he who henceforth
faileth not to praise thee, will have no dread of
me in his heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nala's wrath subsided, and he permitted Kali to enter
the cloven fruit tree. Then he leapt into the chariot and
drove on, and Kali returned unto his own place.</p>

<p>The chariot flew on like a bird, and the soul of Nala
was elated with gladness. But he still retained the form
of Vahuka.</p>

<p>At eventide the watchmen on the walls of Vidarbha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
proclaimed the coming of Rituparna, and King Bhima
gave permission that he should enter by the city gate.</p>

<p>All that region echoed the thunder of the rumbling
chariot. Nala's horses, which Várshneya had driven
from Nishadha, and were within the city, careered and
neighed aloud as if Nala were beside them once again.</p>

<p>Damayantí also heard the approaching chariot, and
her beating heart was like a cloud which thunders as
the rain cometh on. Her soul was thrilled by the
familiar sound, and it seemed to her that Nala was drawing
nigh....<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> On the palace roofs peacocks craned
their necks and danced,<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> and elephants in their stalls,
with uplifted trunks, trumpeted aloud as if rain were
about to fall.</p>

<p>Damayantí said: &#8220;The sound of the chariot fills my
soul with ecstasy. Surely my lord cometh. Oh, if I
see not soon the moon-fair face of Nala I will surely
die, for, thinking of his virtues, my heart is rent with
sorrow. Unless he cometh now I will no longer live,
but will perish by fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>With sorrowful anxiety Damayantí ascended to the roof
terrace of the lofty palace to gaze upon the chariot as
it entered the middle court. She saw Rituparna stepping
down, and Varshneya, who followed him, while Váhuka
began to unyoke the foaming steeds.</p>

<p>King Bhima, who knew naught of his daughter's
stratagem, received the royal Rajah of Ayodhya with
much courtesy, and said: &#8220;I bid thee welcome, O king....
Why hast thou come hither?&#8221;</p>

<p>Now Rituparna wondered greatly that he beheld no
kings or kings' sons, or even signs that a swayamvara
was about to be held, but he kept his counsel and said:
&#8220;I have come to salute thee, O Bhima.&#8221;</p>

<p>The royal sire of Damayantí smiled thereat and said
unto himself: &#8220;He hath not come so speedily through
many cities for such a purpose. But we shall know betimes
why he hath made this journey.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rituparna was conducted to his chamber for rest and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
refreshment by a company of royal servants, and Várshneya
went with them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Vahuka led his horses to the stables, and
Damayantí descended to her chamber, thinking again and
again that the sound of the coming chariot was like to
the sound of Nala drawing nigh. So she called her fair
handmaid, who was named Ke&#347;iní, and said unto her:
&#8220;Go forth and speak to the misshapen charioteer with
short arms, for methinks he is Nala.... Ask thou him
who he is, and be mindful of his answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>The handmaiden went forth and spoke unto Váhuka,
saying: &#8220;Lo! the Princess Damayantí would fain know
whence ye come and for what purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Vahuka: &#8220;King Rituparna hath heard that the
swayamvara is to be held at dawn to-morrow, so he set
forth from Ayodhya and came hither swifter than the
wind. I am his charioteer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ke&#347;iní asked him: &#8220;Who is the third man who hath
come?&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Váhuka: &#8220;Várshneya is his name. He departed
unto Ayodhya when Nala fled away.... I am
skilled in taming steeds and in preparing viands.&#8221;</p>

<p>The handmaiden then asked: &#8220;And doth this Varshneya
know whither Nala hath fled and how he fares.
Hath he told thee aught regarding him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Váhuka: &#8220;Várshneya carried away the children
of Nala from Nishadha, but he knows not aught of the
rajah, O fair one. Indeed, no man knoweth. He hath
assumed a strange form, and wanders disguised about the
world.... Nala alone knoweth, nor will he reveal himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ke&#347;iní then spake, saying:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span> &#8220;When the holy Brahman
went unto the city of Ayodhya he uttered those words of
Damayantí once and once again:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8216;<i>Whither art thou gone, O gambler, who didst sever my
garment in twain? Thou didst leave thy loved one as she lay
slumbering in the savage wood. Lo! she is awaiting thy
return. By day and by night she sitteth alone, consumed by
her grief. Oh! hear her prayer and have compassion, thou
noble hero, because that she ever weepeth for thee in the depths
of her despair.</i>&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Now speak again, I pray thee, the words which thou
didst utter to the Brahman, for they gave healing to the
stricken heart of Damayantí. Fain would the princess
hear that speech once more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then was the soul of Nala rent with grief, hearing
the message of Damayantí, and with tearful voice he said,
repeating his former utterance:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<i>In the excess of her sorrow a noble woman will compose
herself and remain constant, and so win heaven by her virtues.
She is protected by the breastplate of her chastity, and will
suffer no harm. Nor will she yield to anger, although she be
deserted by her lord, whose robe the birds have taken away,
leaving him in sore distress. She will not be moved to wrath
against her husband, the sorrow-stricken and famine-wasted,
who hath been bereft of his kingdom and despoiled of happiness.</i>&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Nala could scarce restrain his emotion as he spoke
these words. Then the fair Ke&#347;iní hastened unto Damayantí
and told all.</p>

<p>In her distress the princess said unto her handmaiden:
&#8220;Go thou and observe this man closely, and return betimes
to inform me of all he doeth. When he doth
prepare viands for his royal master let no fire be given
unto him nor any water.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ke&#347;iní hastened forth to watch the charioteer, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
when she returned she said: &#8220;O princess, this man is
like unto a god. When he approacheth a low-built entrance
he doth not stoop; the portal rises before him.
Much flesh was given unto him to prepare viands for
Rituparna. He but gazed on the empty vessels and
they were filled with water. No fire was lit, and he took
a handful of withered grass and held it up to the sun,
whereupon it blazed instantly, and oh! the marvel, his
fingers were unscorched by the flames. Water flows at
his will, and as quickly it vanisheth. And lo! I beheld
another marvel. When he lifted up flowers that had
faded they were immediately refreshed, so that they had
greater beauty and richer fragrance than before.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p>Damayantí was fully assured that Váhuka was no
other than her husband in altered form, and, weeping,
she said softly: &#8220;Ah! go once again to the kitchen, fair
Ke&#347;iní, and obtain without his knowledge a small portion
of the food which he hath prepared.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ere long the handmaiden returned with a morsel of
well-cooked meat, and when Damayantí, who had ofttimes
tried the food which had been cooked by her
husband, tasted thereof, she uttered a loud cry in her
anguish, and said: &#8220;Yon charioteer is Nala!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she sipped water of ablution,<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> and sent her two
children with Ke&#347;iní to the kitchen. Immediately that
the charioteer beheld Indrasena and her brother he embraced
them tenderly: he gazed lovingly upon the children,
who were as beautiful as the children of the gods,
and his soul was deeply moved, while tears ran down
his cheeks. Seeing that the handmaiden observed him
closely, he said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span> &#8220;Ah! the little ones are so like unto
mine own children that I could not restrain my tears....
Let us part now, O innocent maiden; we are in a land of
strangers, and if thou comest so often men will speak ill
of thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Damayantí was told how the charioteer had
been so profoundly moved when he saw the royal children,
she sent Ke&#347;iní unto her mother, the queen, for
she was impatient to behold her husband once again.
The handmaiden spake to the queen, saying: &#8220;Lo! we
have observed the charioteer closely, and believe that he
is Nala, although misshapen of form. Damayantí is fain
he would come before her, with or without the knowledge
of her sire, and that quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>The queen at once went unto Bhima and told him
all, and the rajah gave permission that the charioteer
should be summoned. In an instant word was sent unto
Nala, and soon he stood before Damayantí and gazed
upon her, and was moved to anguish. The princess was
clad in a robe of scarlet, and her hair was thrown into
disarray and defiled with dust: she wept and trembled
with emotion.</p>

<p>At length Damayantí spoke, saying: &#8220;O Váhuka,
hast thou ever heard of a noble and upright man who
fled away, abandoning his sleeping wife in a forest?
Innocent was she, and worn out with grief. Who was
he who thus forsook his wife but the lordly Nala?...
What offence did I give unto him that he should have
deserted me while I slept? Was he not chosen by me
as mine husband even before the gods?... How could
he abandon her who loved him&mdash;the mother of his children?...
Before the celestial beings he pledged his
faith. How hath he kept his vow?&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke with broken voice, and her dark eyes were
dewed by sorrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span></p>

<p>Nala made answer, gazing upon his beloved wife, and
said: &#8220;My kingdom I lost by the dice, but I was innocent
of evil, because Kali possessed my soul, and by that
demon was I also swayed to desert thee, O timid one!
But thou didst smite him with thy curse when thou wert
in the forest mourning for me, yet he remained in my
body until, in the end, he was conquered by my long-suffering
and devotion. Lo! now, O beauteous one, our
grief is nigh to its end. The evil one hath departed, and
through love of thee I come hither right speedily....
But how,&#8221; he asked sternly, &#8220;may a high-born lady choose
her another husband, as thou wouldst fain do, even now,
O faint heart? The heralds have gone up and down the
land saying: &#8216;<i>The daughter of Bhima will hold her second
swayamvara because such is her fancy.</i>&#8217; And for this reason
Rituparna made haste to come hither.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p>Damayantí shook with emotion when these hard
words were spoken, and she addressed Nala, saying:
&#8220;Do not suspect me, O noble one, of such shameful
guilt. It was for thee and thee alone that the Bráhmans
went forth repeating the message which I addressed unto
them. Lo! when I learned of the words thou didst
speak unto the wise Parnada, I conceived this stratagem
with purpose to bring thee hither. Faithful of heart have
I remained, nor ever have I thought evil of thee. I call
upon the wind to slay me now if I have sinned: on the
sun I call also and on the moon, which enters into every
thought of living beings. Let these three gods who
govern the three worlds<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> speak now to prove my words,
or else turn against me.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the wind which the princess had adjured spake
from without and said: &#8220;O Nala, Damayantí hath done
no evil, nor hath she thought on evil. For three long
years she hath treasured up her virtue in its fullness. She
speaketh what is true even now. Thou hast found the
daughter of Bhima: the daughter of Bhima hath found
thee. Take now thine own wife to thy bosom.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even as the wind was speaking, flowers fell out of
heaven all around them,<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> and the soft music of the gods
floated down the wind. Nala marvelled greatly, and
gazed with love upon the innocent Damayantí. Then
he put on the holy garment and thought upon the king
of serpents. Immediately he resumed his own form,
and the daughter of Bhima beheld her lost husband once
again.</p>

<p>Damayantí shrieked and embraced Nala, and she hid
her face in his bosom. He was again travel-worn and
dust-stained as he clasped her to his heart, and she sighed
softly. Long they stood there, speaking no words, in
silent ecstasy.... The children were brought in and
Nala embraced them once more.</p>

<p>Then did the queen, who rejoiced greatly, inform
Bhima of Nala's return, and he said: &#8220;When he has
performed his ablutions he will be re-united to Damayantí
on the morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>The whole night long the happy pair sat together in
the palace relating all that had befallen them during the
years that they were parted one from another.</p>

<p>On the morn that followed Nala was again wedded
to Damayantí, and thereafter he paid homage to Bhima.
The glad tidings of his return spread swiftly through the
city, and there was great rejoicing. Soon all the houses
were decorated with banners and garlands; the streets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>were watered and strewn with flowers. The altars of
the gods were also adorned.</p>

<p>When Rituparna came to know that his charioteer,
Váhuka, was the Rajah of Nishadha, he was well pleased,
and he went into Nala's presence and said: &#8220;May thou
have joy with thy queen to whom thou art re-united.
Have I ever done aught unjustly unto thee whilst thou
wert in my palace? If so, I now seek thy forgiveness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Nala, &#8220;No injustice have I ever suffered from
thee, mine old friend and kinsman.... I give thee
fully all I have&mdash;my skill in steeds.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rituparna was grateful unto Nala for his gift. He
gave in return fuller instruction in the science of dice,
and thereafter departed to his own city.</p>

<p>When a month had gone past Nala took leave of
King Bhima and went towards Nishadha with one great
chariot, sixteen elephants, fifty armed horsemen, and six
hundred foot soldiers. The whole force entered the city
boldly and made the earth to shake. Nala at once went
before Pushkara and said: &#8220;I would fain throw dice with
thee once again. I have much wealth and will stake
all my treasure and even Damayantí upon the hazard.
Thou, Pushkara, must stake thy kingdom. Let us
stake everything; let us play for our lives. And know,
too, that, according to ancient law, he who wins a kingdom
by gambling must accept the challenge to play the
counter game.... If thou wilt not play, then let us
settle our difference in single combat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pushkara restrained from smiling, for he was confident
of success, so with haughty contempt he made
answer:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is joy to me that thou dost again possess great
treasure to enable thee to play. It is joy also to me
that I can win Damayantí with faultless limbs. Soon,
indeed, will Bhima's daughter be decorated with the
treasure which I shall win; she shall stand by my side
as Apsarás, queen of heaven, stands beside Indra. Long
have I waited for thee so that I might win Damayantí
and be fully satisfied.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nala would fain have drawn his sword, but composed
himself, and, with angry eyes and scornful smile, he said:
&#8220;Cease this idle chatter and let us play. Thereafter thou
wilt have no desire to speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>Immediately the two brothers set to the game, and
Nala won at a single hazard all that he had lost. Then
he smiled and said: &#8220;Now the whole kingdom is mine
once again. Fallen monarch! never wilt thou behold
the fair Damayantí because thou art become her slave....
Know now, that thou didst not triumph heretofore
by reason of thine own skill, but because Kali aided thee,
nor didst thou perceive this, O fool!... But fear not
that I will take vengeance.... I give thee back thy
life. Thou wilt have an estate and revenues and my
friendship, because I remember, O Pushkara, that thou
art my brother.... Mayst thou live for a hundred
years!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Nala embraced his brother, who did homage
with hands folded, saying: &#8220;May thy splendour endure
for ever! May thou live for ten thousand years! Thou
hast given me my life and a city in which to live.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pushkara remained with Nala for a month, and then
went his way to his own domain.</p>

<p>All Nishadha rejoiced because that their rightful king
had returned. The counsellors of state did homage
before Nala, and said: &#8220;There is great joy now in city
and country, and the people come to honour thee even
as Indra is honoured by all the gods.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the rejoicings were over, and the city of Nishadha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
was again tranquil, Damayantí returned home
escorted by a great army, and she brought great treasures
which her royal sire Bhima, the terrible in strength, had
conferred upon her. With the long-eyed queen came
her children also.</p>

<p>Thereafter Nala lived in happiness like unto the
mighty Indra, being happily restored to his kingdom,
and once again the monarch among men. He achieved
great renown as a ruler, and he performed every holy
rite with munificence and devotion.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV_Story_of_Rama_How_Sita_was_Won" id="CHAPTER_XXIV_Story_of_Rama_How_Sita_was_Won">CHAPTER XXIV<br />Story of Rama: How Sita was Won</a></h2>

<p class="blockcontents">The Poet of the <i>Ramayana</i>&mdash;Brahma's Command&mdash;Two Great Kingdoms&mdash;A
Childless Maharajah&mdash;Horse Sacrifice to Obtain Offspring&mdash;The Demon
King of Ceylon&mdash;Gods Appeal to Vishnu for Help&mdash;Birth of Rama and his
Brethren&mdash;Stories of Childhood&mdash;Vishwamitra takes away Rama and Lakshmana&mdash;Forest

<p>Now hear the tale of Rama and Sita, which was related
unto the poet Valmiki<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> by Narada, the renowned
Rishi. Be it told that when Valmiki came to know of
the adventures and achievements of the great prince, he
went towards the river to bathe, musing the while. It
chanced that two fond herons disported on the bank,
when suddenly a passing huntsman shot the male bird,
which at once fell dead in a pool of blood. Great was
the grief of the female heron, and Valmiki's heart was
so deeply moved by its cries of distress that he gave
utterance to his emotions in a stream of metrical speech.
In this manner was the <i>sloka</i> metre invented. Then
came towards the brooding poet the supreme god Brahma,
who smiled and commanded him to celebrate the story
of Rama in the poetic measure which, involuntarily, he
had invented. Valmiki prepared himself accordingly to
fulfil the desire of Brahma. He sat upon a carpet of
Kusa grass, sipped holy water, and became absorbed in
thought, until visions of the story were revealed before
his eyes. Sloka by sloka and book by book, he composed
the <i>Ramayana</i>; and as long as mountains endure
and rivers run towards the sea, so long will it be repeated
by the lips of mankind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span></p>

<p>Valmiki sang that in days of yore there were two
mighty kingdoms in sun-bright Hindustan, and these
were Ko´sala, whose King was Dasarat´ha, father of Rama,
and Mit´hila,<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> which was ruled over by Jan´aka, the father
of beauteous Sita.</p>

<p>Now the capital of Kosala was Ayodhya<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>, which shone
in splendour like to Indra's celestial city; it had wide
streets with large dwellings, richly decorated temples,
towering like mountains, and grand and noble palaces.
In the palace gardens there were numerous birds and
flowers, shady groves of fruit trees, and lakes gemmed
with bee-loved lotuses; the soft winds were wont to beat
back the white water-blooms from the honey bees as coy
maidens are withheld by the impulses of modesty from
their eager lovers. Birds disported on the gleaming
lakes, kingfishers were angered to behold themselves
mirrored in the depths, thinking they gazed upon rivals,
and ruffled the waters with their flapping wings....
The city of Ayodhya was full of prosperous and happy
people.</p>

<p>Maharajah Dasaratha, who was of the Solar Race,
dwelt in a stately palace; it was surrounded by strong
walls, and guarded by a thousand warriors fierce as
flames of consuming fire, and ever watchful like to mountain
lions which protect their dens. Eight sage counsellors
served the monarch with devotion, and he had two
family priests, Vasishtha and Vamadeva.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span></p>

<p>But although Dasaratha was mighty and powerful,
and prospered greatly, his heart was full of sorrow because
that no son had been born to him by either of his
three queens, Kausalya, Kaikeyi, and Sumitra.... At
length he resolved to perform the Aswamedha (horse
sacrifice) so that the gods might be prevailed upon to
grant him an heir who would perpetuate his race. When
his will was made known to the queens, their faces
brightened as the lotus brightens at the promise of
spring.</p>

<p>So it came to pass that a black horse was let loose
on the night of the full moon of the month of Choitro<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>.
A Brahman accompanied it, and after wandering for a
full year, the animal returned again to the kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

<p>Many rajahs attended the ceremony which took place
on the north bank of the Sarayu river. Twenty-one
sacrificial posts were set up for the birds, and beasts, and
reptiles, which were to be offered up besides the horse,
and there were eighteen Homa pits. When the fire was
kindled upon the altar, Kausalya, the chief queen, slew
the horse with the sacred scimitar, while the Brahmans
chanted mantras.... All night long Kausalya and
Kaikeyi, wives of the Maharajah, sat beside the horse's
body, as was needful in performance of the rite....
Portions of the flesh were duly given to the fire, and
when the ceremony was completed, Dasaratha awarded
great gifts of kine and treasure to the Brahmans.</p>

<p>An oblation was afterwards offered to the gods, who
came to the place of sacrifice with the music-loving
Gandharvas, the Celestial saints, the Siddhas<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>, and seven
Deva-rishis. Brahma came with Vishnu and Shiva, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>Indra came also with the hastening Maruts. Ere they
departed, the gods promised that four sons would be
born to Dasaratha.</p>

<p>After this, Indra and the other gods<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> journeyed to
the heaven of Brahma, and spake regarding Ravana<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>,
the monarch of demons, who had his dwelling in
Lanká.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<p>Now Ravana had performed such great penances that
Brahma rendered him invulnerable to gods and demons,
with the result that the demon made Yama, god of
death, his slave, and put Agni and Vayu, and the sun
and moon, under subjection; indeed, he oppressed all the
gods and obstructed sacrifices and despoiled the Brahmans.
So Indra and other minor deities entreated Brahma to
deliver them from the sway of Ravana.</p>

<p>Brahma heard the gods, and then conducted them to
Vishnu's dwelling in the Ocean of Milk. Indra and the
others honoured the Preserver, and cried: &#8220;O Lord of
the Universe, remove the afflictions which press heavily
upon us. Brahma hath blessed Ravana, nor can recall
his gift. Save us, therefore, from the oppression of the
demon king.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vishnu spake and said: &#8220;Be not afraid, for I shall
deliver you all. Ravana entreated Brahma for protection
against all beings save the apes and men. Go therefore
towards the earth, ye gods, and assume the guise of apes,
and lo! I will divide myself into four parts and be born
as the four sons of Maharajah Dasaratha. When I shall
battle against Ravana, you will hasten to mine aid.&#8221;</p>

<p>It came to pass that the wives of Dasaratha, who had
eaten of sacrificial food, became the mothers of sons&mdash;Kausalya
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>of Rama, Kaikeyi of Bharata, and Sumitra of
Laksh´mana, and Satrughna. The people of the kingdom
rejoiced greatly; they danced and sang and decked
Ayodhya with streamers and flower garlands.</p>

<p>Of the four children Rama was the most beautiful:
lying in his white cradle he was like to a blue lotus
bloom amidst the gleaming waves of the Ganges. Vasishtha,
the wise Brahman, perceived that he had all the
marks of Vishnu, and revealed his knowledge to the
Maharajah, by whom the child was well beloved. One
evening the full moon rose in all its splendour, and Rama
stretched out his hands because he desired to have it for
a toy. His mother bought him jewels, but he threw
them from him and wailed and wept until his eyes were
red and swollen. Many of the women assembled round
the cradle in deep concern. One said that the child was
hungry, but he refused to drink; another that the Sasti
was unpropitious, and offerings were at once made to that
goddess; still Rama wept. A third woman declared that
a ghost haunted and terrified the child, and mantras were
chanted.</p>

<p>When the women found that they were unable to
soothe Kausalya's son, the Maharajah was called, but
Rama heeded him not. In his despair Dasaratha sent
for his chief counsellor, who placed in Rama's hands a
mirror which reflected the moon. Then the little prince
was comforted, believing that he had obtained the moon;
he ceased to weep, and everyone was put at ease once
again.</p>

<p>When the children grew older they began to lisp
words, and as they were unable to pronounce &#8220;peeta&#8221;
and &#8220;mata&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> they said &#8220;pa&#8221; and &#8220;ma&#8221;. If Rama
were asked his name, he answered &#8220;Ama&#8221;. Sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>the Maharajah sat among his sage counsellors with the
little boy upon his knee.</p>

<p>In their third year the princes had their ears pierced,
and after that they played with other children. They
made clay images of gods and put clay offerings in their
mouths, and they broke the images because they would
not eat.</p>

<p>Their education began when they were five years old.
Vasishtha was the preceptor, and first he worshipped
Saraswati, goddess of learning, and instructed his pupils
to make offerings of flowers and fruit. They received
instruction daily, beginning with the alphabet; then they
studied grammar, and at length they mastered eighteen
languages; they were also instructed in music and dancing
and painting, and in all the sciences. From time to
time the princes were examined by their royal sire in
the presence of his counsellors. Afterwards they were
trained to exercise in arms and take part in military
sports, and they became skilled archers, and elephant
riders, and horsemen and charioteers. Of all the princes
Rama was the most accomplished; he rose above the
others like to a flag which flutters proudly above a high
dome.</p>

<p>Now when the princes were sixteen years old, their
royal sire began to consider what brides should be
selected for them. It chanced that while he was discussing
this matter one day with his counsellors, Vishwamitra
paid a visit to the palace. Dasaratha welcomed
him with due honours, and spake saying: &#8220;Speak and
tell what is thy request so that I may grant it speedily.&#8221;</p>

<p>That mighty sage, who had been a Kshatriya in
former times, but became a Brahman after practising
rigid and long austerities, made answer and said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span> &#8220;O
Maharajah, the Rakshasas are destroying our sacrificial
offerings, and I pray you to permit Rama to return with
me to my hermitage, for he is mighty and brave and
young and is able to overpower the demons.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reluctantly did Dasaratha consent, but not until
Vasishtha had reassured him, and he commanded that
Lakshmana should accompany Rama to the hermitage.
Then the princes took leave of their parents and went
away with Vishwamitra.</p>

<p>On the first night they abode in a hermitage situated
where the river Sarayu pours into the Ganges, and the
sage informed the princes that on that very spot Shiva
had been wounded by the arrows of Kamadeva, god of
love, whom he angrily consumed with the fire that issued
from his third eye.</p>

<p>Next day the sage led the two princes towards a dark
and fearsome jungle haunted by numerous beasts of prey,
in which dwelt the terrible Rakshasa woman named
Taraka, mother of Maricha;<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> she was misshapen and
horrible, and continually ravaged all that country. Rama
twanged his bow to challenge her, and she came towards
the princes roaring angrily and throwing boulders. Because
she was a female, the sons of Dasaratha were reluctant
to cause her death. Rama shot arrows and cut off
both her arms, and Lakshmana deprived her of nose and
ears. She immediately changed her shape and became
invisible, but by the power of sorcery continued to cause
many stones to fall in showers about the young heroes.
Vishwamitra urged Rama to slay her, and, guided by
sound alone, he shot a great arrow which caused her
death. Then the sage rejoiced greatly, and embracing
Rama kissed his head.</p>

<p>In the morning Vishwamitra chanted powerful mantras,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>which caused Celestial weapons to appear for Rama,
and the spirits of the weapons stood before the prince
with clasped hands and said: &#8220;<i>We are thy servants, O
nobly generous one. Good betide thee! Whatever thou dost
desire, lo! we shall accomplish for thee.</i>&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p>Said Rama: &#8220;When I have need of you, I will think
of you, and then you will wait upon me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereafter Vishwamitra led the princes to his hermitage,
which was situated in a pleasant grove where deer
disported and birds sang sweetly. All the sages welcomed
them. It chanced that when six days had gone
past, the Brahmans prepared to offer up a sacrifice. Suddenly
a band of Rakshasas, led by Maricha, son of the
hag Taraka and Savahu, rushed towards the altar to defile
the offering with bones and blood. Rama thought of his
Celestial weapons, and they immediately appeared beside
him. He cast one at Maricha which drove him hundreds
of miles out to sea, and he threw a fire weapon at Savahu
which consumed him; then he attacked and slew all the
other demons.... The sages rejoiced greatly, and honoured
the prince.</p>

<p>Next morning Vishwamitra informed Rama and Lakshmana
that he and the other sages purposed to attend a
great sacrifice which was to be offered up by Janaka, Rajah
of Mithila. &#8220;You will accompany us,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
the rajah will show you Shiva's great bow, which neither
god nor man can break.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, both while they abode at the hermitage and as
they journeyed towards Mithila, the princes heard the
sacred legends of Vishnu in his dwarf incarnation, of
the Churning of the Ocean, of the descent of Ganga
through Shiva's hair, and of the cursing of Indra by a
sage.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span></p>
<p>At length they reached the capital of Janaka,<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> King of
Mithila, who welcomed Vishwamitra, and said: &#8220;Who
are these courageous young men with the majesty of
elephants and the fearlessness of tigers? Comely are they
as the twin Aswins.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said the sage: &#8220;These are sons of Dasaratha; they
are slayers of Rakshasas, and desire greatly to behold
Shiva's mighty bow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the monarch spake to the nobles and warriors,
and said: &#8220;Bring forth the bow.&#8221;</p>

<p>His command was immediately obeyed. From an
inner hall many stalwart men hauled the stupendous bow
on an eight-wheeled iron chariot into the presence of the
monarch of Mithila.</p>

<p>&#8220;Behold the bow of Shiva!&#8221; cried the warriors.</p>

<p>Said Janaka: &#8220;Behold the mighty bow which has
been treasured by generations of kings. Many rajahs
and warriors have endeavoured in vain to bend it; even
Rakshasas and Asuras have failed; the gods themselves
quail before it.... To the rajah who can bend this
mighty weapon I will give in marriage my daughter, the
beauteous Sita.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rama gazed with wonder, and then said: &#8220;Permit me
to lift and bend thy bow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wondering greatly at these words, the monarch and
many high nobles and strong warriors gathered round
about.... With smiling face, Rama lifted the bow;
then proudly he strung it, whereat those who looked on
were all amazed.... The prince put forth his strength
and bent the bow with resistless force until it snapped in
the middle with a terrible noise like to thunder; the earth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>shook and the mountains echoed aloud.... At the loud
crash, which resembled the roar of Indra's thunderbolt,
all who were present fell down stunned and terrified
save Janaka and Vishwamitra and the two sons of
Dasaratha.</p>

<p>Said the monarch: &#8220;Now have mine eyes beheld a
great wonder. Peerless is Rama, the noble one, and he
shall be given for wife my daughter Sita, who is dearer
to me than life.... Let speedy messengers hasten unto
Dasaratha and bid him to come hither.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Dasaratha reached Janaka's capital, Rama and
Sita were wedded amidst great rejoicings.</p>

<p>Happy were the lovers together. When they arrived
at Ayodhya the people welcomed them, and Dasaratha's
queens embraced and kissed the soft-eyed bride of peerless
fame.</p>

<p>It is told that on their honeymoon they loved to wander
in the moonlight. On a night of warmth and beauty they
went to the banks of a pond which sparkled with lotus
blooms.</p>

<p>Said Rama: &#8220;My loved one, graceful art thou as the
lotus, thy hair is like silken moss, thine eyes like beautiful
bees; fair is thy face as the moon's soft image
amidst the waters, thine arms are shapely lotus stalks,
and thy bosom is like to buds of sweet lotus, O my
peerless bride.&#8221;</p>

<p>They plunged together into the cool, moon-swept
waters, and Rama cast at his bride many fair water
blooms. Sita retreated before him until she went beyond
her depth; then she clung lovingly to Rama, twining her
arms about his neck, nor did he hasten to draw her back,
so dearly he loved to be embraced by her.</p>

<p>Hide-and-seek they then played amidst the floating
flowers. Rama sank down until his face only was seen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
and Sita, who searched for him, knew not whether she
saw the face of Rama or a blue lotus bloom on the surface
of the pond. Bending down to smell what seemed
to be a flower, she touched her lover's lips, and he kissed
her sweetly. Then Sita hid herself, and her face was
like to a lotus bloom among lotus blooms. Rama kissed
her many times ere she moved or smiled.... At length
they darted merrily from the pond in bright moonlight,
their garments dripping sparkling water drops, and then
they drank cups of honey; the heart of Sita was intoxicated,
and she babbled words of love and sweetness....</p>

<p>Rama and Sita spent happy hours together, sharing
supreme joy like to Vishnu and peerless Lakshmi in the
bright Celestial regions.</p>

<p>The Maharajah Dasaratha was growing old, and his
counsellors and the people began to consider who should
be appointed Yuvarajah (Young Rajah), to take over the
duties of sovereignty and allow the monarch to spend his
closing years in preparation for death, so that he might
secure heaven in the next life.</p>

<p>All the sages and chieftains favoured the choice of
Rama, and the heart of Dasaratha was filled with joy.
The people rejoiced also when it was told to them that
Rama was to become their ruler, and they raised shouts
of triumph and gladness. Then Rama was sent for, and
the Maharajah blessed him and bade him to spend the
night in Vishnu's temple with his wife Sita, to prepare
for the ceremony of installation on the morrow. That
night the city of Ayodhya was illuminated, and the people
prepared to decorate the streets with garlands and streamers
when the dawn came.</p>

<p>Now there was one who did not rejoice, because that
she hated Rama, son of the queen Kausalya. This was
the old nurse of Prince Bharata, son of the queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
Kaikeyi<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>. Her name was Manthara; she had been the slave
of Kaikeyi while that queen yet abode in the palace of
her sire, the rajah Aswapati. Ugly and misshapen was
Manthara; she was short-necked, flat-breasted, and had
legs like a crane; she was big-bellied and humpbacked.
When Rama was a child she had offended him and he
smote her, and ever afterwards she regarded him with
fierce enmity.</p>

<p>It chanced that Kaikeyi was gazing idly from the
palace roof on the illuminated and bustling streets, when
the hunchbacked slave approached her, and said: &#8220;Canst
thou be merry, O foolish one, on this night? Thou art
threatened by dire misfortune. Dasaratha hath deceived
thee. Thy son Bharata hath been sent to thy father's
city, so that the son of Kausalya may be installed as
Yuvarajah on the morrow. Henceforth thou wilt be the
bondswoman of Kausalya, Rama's mother, and thou wilt
have to wait obediently on the commands of proud Sita.
Hasten now and prevent this dread happening.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Kaikeyi: &#8220;Why do you hate Rama? He is the
eldest son of the chief queen, and Bharata could not become
Yuvarajah without the consent of Kausalya's son,
who honours me as he honours his own mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>Manthara fumed with wonder and indignation at these
words; then she said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span> &#8220;What madness hath blinded
thee? What folly maketh thee heedless of the gulf of
sorrow which awaiteth thee and thy son? I am older
than thou art, and have seen dark deeds committed in
royal houses. Can Bharata become the slave of Rama?
Well I know that jealous Rama will drive thy lordly son
into exile and mayhap slay him.... Arise, thou heedless
queen, and save Bharata, lest he be sent to wander
alone in the fearsome jungle. Speak thy mandate to the
Maharajah, whose heart hath been captivated by thy
beauty.... Any other woman but thee would rather
die than suffer a rival wife to triumph over her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Kaikeyi, whose heart began to burn with jealous
anger: &#8220;How can I prevail upon Dasaratha to exalt my
son and send Rama into exile?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the hunchback reminded Bharata's mother that
she had been promised two boons by her husband. In
time past Dasaratha had gone to help Indra to wage war
against the demons. He was grievously wounded and
would have died, but Kaikeyi cured him. So he vowed
to grant her two boons, and she said: &#8220;When I have
need of two favours, I will remind thee of thy promise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Manthara spake to the queen mother of Bharata,
saying: &#8220;Now go to the mourning chamber and feign
sorrow and anger. The Maharajah will seek thee out,
and when he findeth thee demand of him the two boons
which he promised aforetime.&#8221;</p>

<p>So it came to pass that in the mourning chamber
Kaikeyi spake to Dasaratha, and said: &#8220;Now grant me
the two boons as thou didst vow to do, or I shall die this
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said the Maharajah: &#8220;Speak thy wishes, and they
will be granted. May I never achieve bliss if thy desires
are not fulfilled.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kaikeyi said: &#8220;Let royal deeds redeem royal words.
The first boon I ask is that my son Bharata be installed
as Yuvarajah; the second is that Rama be banished for
fourteen years to live in the jungle as a devotee clad in
a robe of bark.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Dasaratha heard these awful words he swooned
and fell prone like to a tempest-smitten tree.... At
length he recovered his senses, and opening his eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
said: &#8220;Have I dreamed a fearsome dream? Do demons
torture me? Is my mind clouded with madness?...&#8221;</p>

<p>Hushed and trembling, he gazed upon Kaikeyi as a
startled deer gazes at a tigress.... He was as helpless
as a serpent which hath been mantra-charmed, and for a
time he sobbed aloud.... At length wrath possessed
him, and, red-eyed and loud-voiced, he reproached her,
saying: &#8220;Traitress, wouldst thou bring ruin to my
family?... Rama hath never wronged thee; why dost
thou seek to injure him? O Kaikeyi, whom I have loved
and taken to my bosom, thou hast crept into my house
like a poisonous snake to accomplish my ruin. It is
death to me to part with my brave and noble Rama, now
that I am old and feeble.... Have pity on me and ask
for other boons.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Kaikeyi, coldly and bitterly: &#8220;If thou wilt break
thy vow now to one who saved thy life, all men will
despise thee, and I will drink poison this very night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dasaratha was made silent a time. Then he spoke
with tears, and said: &#8220;Beautiful art thou, O Kaikeyi.
Thou hast taken captive my heart. How can this evil
desire dwell in thy bosom and darken it with guile?
Thou hast entrapped me with the bait of thy beauty....
Can a father dishonour his well-loved son? Rather
would I enter hell than send Rama into exile. How can
I look upon his face again? How can I suffer to behold
him parting with gentle Sita?... Oh! I have drunk of
sweet wine mingled with poison.... Have pity on me,
O Kaikeyi! I fall at thy feet.... I would that Yama
would snatch me off in this hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Kaikeyi: &#8220;If thou dost honour truth thou wilt
grant the boons I crave, but if thou wouldst rather break
thine oath, let me drink poison now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dasaratha cried in his grief:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span> &#8220;O shadow-robed
Night, decked with stars! arrest the hours that pass by,
or else give my heart release. Cover with thy darksome
mantle my sorrow and my shame, and hide this deed of
crime from the knowledge of mankind. Let me perish
ere the dawn; may the sun never rise to shine upon my
sin-smeared life.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he lamented through the night, and unto Kaikeyi
he said: &#8220;I grant the boons, but I reject thee for ever and
thy son Bharata also.&#8221;</p>

<p>Morning dawned.... The city was decorated with
streamers and flowers. A golden throne was set up for
Rama; the tiger's skin was spread for his feet; the white
umbrella waited for him. Elephants and chariot horses
were harnessed.... The preparations for the sacrifice
were completed.... The crowds began to gather in the
streets waiting for the Maharajah and noble Rama, whom
all the people loved.</p>

<p>Towards the palace went Sumantra, the chief counsellor.
He entered the chamber in which Dasaratha had
spent the night to awaken him and conduct him to the
ceremony.</p>

<p>Kaikeyi met the counsellor and said: &#8220;Summon
Rama hither, for the Maharajah must speak with
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wondering greatly, Sumantra hastened to the prince's
dwelling and spake the royal command. Said Rama:
&#8220;I will go quickly. Tarry here, O Sita, and await my
return.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sita followed Rama to the doorway and invoked the
gods so that they might bless and protect him.</p>

<p>The multitudes of people hailed the prince as he was
driven in his chariot towards the palace, and women threw
flowers upon him from the housetops.... He entered
the gate, driving through the first three courts; he dismounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
and walked across the two inner courts; he then
bade his followers to remain without, and soon he stood
before the Maharajah and made humble obeisance.</p>

<p>Rama beheld his father sitting beside Kaikeyi; his
body was bent, his face was worn with grief. Tears fell
from Dasaratha's eyes as his son kissed his feet and the
feet of Kaikeyi also; he strove to speak while tears
streamed from his eyes, but all he could utter was, &#8220;Oh!
Rama....&#8221; The sorrow of Dasaratha rose and fell in
his heart like to the waves of a stormy sea.</p>

<p>Said Rama: &#8220;Oh! have I offended my sire? Speak,
mother, and tell. Wherefore do tears fall from his eyes?
Why is his face clouded with grief?... I would rather
die than wound his heart by word or deed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kaikeyi said: &#8220;The Maharajah is not angered, nor is
he grief-stricken, but he fears to speak his purpose until
thou dost promise to serve his will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Rama: &#8220;O speak and I will obey even if I am
asked to quaff poison and die ere my time. My promise
is given and my lips have never lied.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kaikeyi said coldly: &#8220;The Maharajah vowed to grant
two boons when I cured his wounds and saved his life,
although he repents his promise now like to a man of low
caste. I have asked him to fulfil his vow, and the boons
I crave are that Bharata, whose star is bright, be installed
as Yuvarajah, and thou shouldst be banished for twice
seven years.... If thou art ready to obey thy father's
will and preserve his honour, thou wilt depart this day
from the city and permit Bharata to govern the kingdom.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dasaratha's heart was pierced with agony at these words,
but Rama heard them unmoved; they fell upon his ears
like to sparks falling into the sea. Calmly he spake and
said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span> &#8220;I will depart this day in fulfilment of my father's
vow. Cheerfully will I obey his command. Let Bharata
be summoned quickly from Girivrajah, and I will hasten
to the jungle of Dandaka.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Kaikeyi: &#8220;So be it.... But tarry not, for thy
sire will neither wash nor eat until thou hast departed
hence.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rama bowed before his sire who was prostrated with
sorrow; he bowed before Kaikeyi also.... All the
royal attendants wept, but Rama was unmoved as is the
ocean when a pot of water is drawn from it or poured in.</p>

<p>He went towards Kausalya, his mother, who was
engaged making offerings to Vishnu on his behalf, and
informed her what had taken place.</p>

<p>Kausalya wept and cried: &#8220;O dearly beloved, if thou
hadst never been born I would not have to suffer this
calamity.... My son, I am the chief queen, but Kaikeyi
hath supplanted me, and I am disliked and neglected by
my husband.... I am old and unable to endure the
loss of thee, my son.... Hath my heart grown hard as
rock that it will not break now? Is Yama's mansions so
full that I am not called away? I have no desire to live
any longer.... Can a son obey a sire in his dotage?...
Rama, Rama, the people will rise in revolt; seize thou
the throne, and if thy father remaineth hostile slay him,
because he hath become contemptible before all men,
being but a woman's slave.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lakshmana said: &#8220;Mother, thy words are just. Who
will dare oppose Rama so long as I serve him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Kausalya: &#8220;Hear the words of thy brother, Rama.
If thy sire's command must be obeyed so must mine, and
I command thee now not to depart to the jungle. If thou
wilt not obey me, I will eat no more food and thou wilt
be guilty of my death.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rama said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span> &#8220;I must obey my sire's command. Permit
me, therefore, O mother, to depart now.... O Lakshmana,
I have promised my sire to obey. Do not ask me
to break my plighted word.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still Kausalya pleaded with Rama to remain, and he
sought to comfort her, but her grief was too heavy to
be removed, for she loved her son dearly and hated her
rival Kaikeyi.</p>

<p>With darkened brow and saddened eyes, Rama then
went unto Sita and told her all, and said: &#8220;My mother
is heartbroken, O Sita; she hath need of thee to soothe
her grief. O dearly beloved, I must now depart and
leave thee. Be ever obedient unto Bharata, nor laud me
ever, for a rajah cares not to hear another praised in his
presence.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Sita: &#8220;A wife must ever accompany her husband
and share his sufferings. If thou must depart to the
forest, it is my duty to go before thee and smooth the
thorns in thy path. So long as I am with thee I will be
happy even in the jungle. Dearer to me than the palace
is the place where I can hold sweet converse with my
husband. I will lighten thy burden of sorrow, O Rama,
but if thou wilt leave me here alone I will surely die.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rama spoke of the perils of the jungle, which was full
of wild beasts and venomous reptiles, where food was
scarce, and, when found, bitter to taste, where they would
find no home and would have to lie on the bare ground,
and where they would suffer greatly from heat and cold,
from tempest and rains. &#8220;O Sita,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;thou art
dearer to me than life itself. How can I permit thee to
suffer for me? My love will grow greater when I know
what it is to be separated from thee.... Wait here, O
loved one, until I return again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Sita:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span> &#8220;I know nor fear the perils and sorrows of
the jungle. Rather would I sleep with thee on the bare
ground than lie here alone on a bed of down. Without
thee I have no desire to live.... Take me with thee,
O Rama, and let me share thy sorrow and thy joys.
Sweeter will be the jungle with thee beside me than the
palace when thou hast departed.&#8221;</p>

<p>In vain Rama remonstrated with her, but she refused
to be separated from him. She fell at his feet, weeping
bitterly, and at length he consented that she should share
his sufferings in the jungle.</p>

<p>Then Lakshmana pleaded to accompany Rama also,
nor could he be persuaded to remain behind.</p>

<p>Thereafter Rama and Sita and Lakshmana went together,
walking barefooted, towards the palace to bid farewell
to the Maharajah and his queens.</p>

<p>Rumours of what had happened were passing through
the city, and the people gazed with sorrow on Rama, his
bride and his brother, and some said: &#8220;The Maharajah
is possessed by demons.&#8221; Others said: &#8220;Let us desert
the city and follow Rama. Then Bharata will have none
left to rule over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rama entered the palace with his wife and brother,
and stood before the Maharajah with folded hands.</p>

<p>Dasaratha lamented and said: &#8220;A woman hath
deceived me. She concealed her wicked designs in her
heart as a fire is concealed by ashes.... The evening is
late; tarry therefore with thy mother and me until day
breaks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Rama: &#8220;Kaikeyi commanded me to depart this
day to the jungle, and I promised to obey.... When
fourteen years have gone past we shall return again and
honour thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Maharajah and his counsellors desired to send
the royal army and the huntsmen and much grain and
treasure to the jungle with Rama, although Kaikeyi
protested loudly, but Rama refused to have soldiers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
followers, and asked for the raiment of bark which he
must wear, and for the spade with which to dig roots and
the basket to carry them.</p>

<p>The shameless Kaikeyi then went away and returned
with three dresses of bark. Rama and Lakshmana
immediately cast off their royal garments and all their
ornaments, and assumed the rough attire of devotees.
But Sita, who from childhood had been clad in silk, wept
and said: &#8220;How can I wear raiment of bark? I cannot
use such attire.&#8221;</p>

<p>All the women shed tears at these words, and Dasaratha
said: &#8220;Kaikeyi's command is binding on Rama only,
and his wife and brother may assume any garments they
desire.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the robe of bark was taken away from Sita; it was
not permitted that she should be put to shame.</p>

<p>Then Rama and Sita and Lakshmana took leave of
all those who were in the palace, and, amidst lamentation
and wailing, took their departure from the palace. They
were conveyed to the frontier of the kingdom in a chariot,
and many people followed them from the city, resolved
to share exile with Rama. The night was spent on the
banks of the Tamasa, and all slept save Rama alone. As
soon as dawn came, he awakened Sita and Lakshmana
and the charioteer, and together they departed ere the
slumbering multitude were aware. The exiles thereafter
parted with the charioteer, and crossing the river Tamasa,
journeyed on till they saw the sacred Ganges, in which
the gods are wont to bathe, and on whose banks many
sages had chosen hermitages.</p>

<p>When the people awoke and found that those whom
they loved and honoured had hastened away, they returned
with hearts full of sorrow to the mourning city
of Ayodhya.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV_The_Abduction_of_Sita" id="CHAPTER_XXV_The_Abduction_of_Sita">CHAPTER XXV<br />The Abduction of Sita</a></h2>

<p class="blockcontents">The Maharajah's Doom&mdash;Tale of the Hermit's Son&mdash;A Curse Fulfilled&mdash;Death
of Dasaratha&mdash;Bharata Refuses the Throne&mdash;Visit to Rama in Exile&mdash;Loyalty
to a Dead Sire&mdash;Javala the Sceptic&mdash;Bharata Honours Rama's Sandals&mdash;Wanderings

Plot&mdash;The Magic Deer&mdash;Rama and Lakshmana Lured from Hermitage&mdash;Sita
Taken Captive.</p>


<p>Now the Maharajah Dasaratha was doomed to die a
sorrowful death. Be it known that in his youth, when
he loved to go a-hunting, he heard in the jungle depths
one evening a gurgling of water, and thought an elephant
or a deer had come to drink from a hidden stream. He
drew his bow; he aimed at the sound and discharged an
arrow.... A human voice uttered a cry of agony....
Breaking through the tangled jungle growth, Dasaratha
discovered that he had mortally wounded a young hermit
who had come to draw water for his aged parents. The
poor victim forgave the king and counselled him, saying:
&#8220;Hasten to my sire and inform him of my fate, lest his
curse should consume thee as a fire consumes a withered
tree.&#8221; Then he expired.</p>

<p>Dismayed and sorrowing deeply, Dasaratha went towards
the dwelling of the boy's parents, who were blind
and old. He heard the father cry: &#8220;Ah! why hast thou
lingered, my son? I am athirst, and thy mother longs
for thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>In broken accents the king informed the lonesome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
parents of their son's death. The sire lamented aloud,
and said: &#8220;Oh! lead me to my son. Let me embrace
him for the last time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dasaratha conducted the weeping parents to the spot
where the lad lay lifeless and stained with blood. The
sire clasped the body, and cried: &#8220;Oh! wilt thou not
speak and greet me, my son? Thou liest on the ground;
thou dost not answer me when I call. Alas! thou canst
not love me any longer.... Thy mother is here. Oh!
thou who wert dutiful and kind, speak but one tender
word to her and to me.... Who will now read to us
each morning the holy books? Who will now find roots
and fruits to feed us?... Oh! tarry with us yet a little
longer, my son. Wait for us ere thou dost depart to the
Kingdom of Death&mdash;stay but one day longer, and on the
morrow thy father and mother will go with thee on the
weary and darksome path of no returning.... How
can we live now that our child and protector is taken
from us?&#8221;</p>

<p>So the blind old hermit lamented. Then he spake to
the king, and said: &#8220;I had but this one child and thou
hast made me childless. Now slay me also, because
Death is blunted and unable to hurt me any more....
A father cannot feel greater agony than when he
sorrows for a beloved son. This peculiar sharp sorrow
thou wilt yet know, O king. As I weep now, and as
I am hastened to death, mourning for my son, so wilt
thou suffer in like manner, sorrowing for a dearly-beloved
and righteous son. Thy death, O Dasaratha, will cleanse
thee of this crime.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having spoken thus, the hermit built the funeral pyre
for the dead boy, and when it was lit he and his wife
leapt amidst the flames and entered the Kingdom of
Death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span></p>

<p>After Rama had departed from Ayodhya, his mother,
Kausalya, reproached Dasaratha, saying: &#8220;Thou wouldst
not break thy promise to Kaikeyi, but thou didst break
thy promise made to thy counsellors that Rama should
be thy successor.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Maharajah was bowed down with grief, and
cried: &#8220;Oh! forgive me, Kausalya, because my heart is
breaking while I mourn for my beloved son. Oh! do
not wound me again, I pray thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kausalya wept and said: &#8220;Alas! my grief hath made
me speak cruelly to thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the middle of the second night after Rama had
departed, Dasaratha awoke and cried: &#8220;O Kausalya, I am
dying with grief. Mine eyes have grown blind with
weeping. Take my hand in thine and speak unto me.
Oh! bitterly I grieve now that I cannot look upon Rama
ere I die. Happy are they whose eyes behold him....
My heart beats feebly&#8221;....</p>

<p>When he had spoken thus, Dasaratha fell back and
was silent. Kausalya, mother of Rama, and Sumitra,
mother of Lakshmana, knelt beside him, and they
swooned when his spirit fled.</p>

<p>In the morning messengers were sent speedily to
Bharata, who sojourned in the kingdom of the Kaikeyas
with his mother's sire, the rajah Aswapati, bidding him
to return without delay. Seven nights passed while the
prince journeyed towards Ayodhya. He knew not that
Dasaratha had died until he reached the palace. Then
Kaikeyi, his mother, informed him without tears. Bharata
wept, and flung himself down upon the floor and cried
aloud.</p>

<p>Kaikeyi said: &#8220;Thou shouldst not thus give way to
grief, my son.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Bharata:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span> &#8220;If the Maharajah were alive, he would
have embraced and kissed me on my return. But
where is Rama, who is now as a sire unto me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Kaikeyi told him all that had taken place, and
said: &#8220;For thy sake, my son, I have accomplished this.
Sorrow not, because thou wilt be installed as ruler here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Bharata: &#8220;I have lost my father and my elder
brother. Of what good is a kingdom unto me now?
O evil-hearted woman, thou hast bereft this house of all
joy; thou hast slain my sire and banished Rama....
But I will bring my brother back from the jungle; he
shall be seated on the throne.&#8221;</p>

<p>Satrughna sorrowed like Bharata, and when he beheld
the wicked hunchback Manthara he threw her down
and dragged her across the floor, saying: &#8220;This hateful
creature is the cause of our calamities. I will slay
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kaikeyi flew away in terror, and Bharata said: &#8220;Slay
her not, because she is a woman. I would have killed
my wicked mother, but, had I done so, Rama would
ne'er have forgiven me nor have spoken to me again.
Spare this wretch, O Satrughna, lest Rama should be
angry with thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kausalya, mother of Rama, then approached Bharata
and said: &#8220;The raj is now thine, O ambitious one. Thy
mother hath secured it for thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bharata fell at her feet and vowed that he would
never sit on the throne, but would hasten after Rama
to entreat him to return.</p>

<p>Then Kausalya wept and embraced him because that
he was loyal to his elder brother.</p>

<p>When Bharata had performed the funeral rites for
the Maharajah, he left Ayodhya with a strong army to
search for Rama.</p>

<p>The two brothers met in the jungle of Chitra-kuta,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
and they embraced one another and wept for their dead
sire.</p>

<p>In the morning Bharata spake to Rama in the
presence of the army, saying: &#8220;This raj, which was
given unto me against my will, I now gift unto thee,
mine elder brother. Accept it and remove the stain
of my mother's sin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Rama: &#8220;O Bharata, my royal sire, fulfilling his
vow, banished me to the jungle and appointed thee to the
raj. A faithful son cannot recall the mandate of his sire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Java´li, the Brahmanic counsellor of Dasaratha,
spake and said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span> &#8220;O Rama, why dim thine understanding
with empty maxims? Thou hast already obeyed thy
sire. It is foolish to think that thou shouldst continue
this allegiance to one who is dead. A man enters the
world alone and departs alone; he owns not friendship
to kindred. His parents are to him like a wayside inn
which he leaves in the morning; his allegiance to them
is temporary. He meets them like a traveller who
tarries on his journey and then goes on his way as
before. In this world we have only one life to live.
If thou wilt refuse this raj thou wilt destroy thy one life.
I am sorry for those who scorn the blessings of this
world so long as they are alive in the hope that they
will reach a Paradise which does not exist. When this
life is spent we are extinguished for ever. Alas! that
men should make to their ancestors useless offerings.
Can a dead man eat thereof? These offerings are a
waste of food. If the soul endures and passes into a new
body how can it benefit from food eaten by another?
These practices were invented by cunning priests with
selfish motives.... There is no Hereafter. Therefore
snatch the joys of life while thou canst, O Rama, take
the raj which is offered to thee and return to Ayodhya.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Rama, whose heart was filled with anger: &#8220;O
Javali, thy motive is excellent but thy doctrines are false.
A good man is distinguished from an evil man by his
deeds. How can I, who have embraced a virtuous life,
turn now into the path of evildoing? The gods who
read a man's heart would curse me for my sins. Vain
are thine idle words; thy reasoning is cunning but false.
Truth is our ancient path. Truth endures when all else
passes away. The venom of falsehood is more deadly
than the venom of a serpent's sting. Thou hast said
that there is no Hereafter, and that we should snatch
pleasures while life endures. If that is so, why do wise
men condemn what is evil if the vicious are simply
pursuing the quest of happiness? Why do sages live
austere lives, eating fruits and roots, instead of feasting
on flesh and drinking wine? There would be no sciences
if we believed only those things we behold. Inferential
proof must be permitted. Is a woman to consider herself
a widow when her husband is out of sight?...
Know, all of ye, that I will be faithful to the mandate
of my sire. I will keep my promise which I cannot
recall. Let Bharata reign, for I will dwell in the
jungle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bharata said: &#8220;If my sire's wish must be fulfilled,
let me remain in the jungle for fourteen years so that
Rama may return to Ayodhya.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Rama: &#8220;Neither Bharata nor I can recall or
change the commands of Dasaratha.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereafter Bharata gave to Rama a pair of new
sandals decked with gold, saying: &#8220;Put these upon thy
feet and they shall accomplish the good of all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rama put on the sandals and then returned them to
his brother, who said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span> &#8220;I will live as a devotee for
fourteen years with matted hair and in a robe of bark.
These sandals, O Rama, will be placed upon the throne
which I will guard for thee. If thou dost not return
when the time of thy penance is ended, I will perish
upon the pyre.&#8221;</p>

<p>The brethren then took leave of one another. Bharata
returned to Ayodhya, and to his counsellors spake, saying:
&#8220;I will dwell outside the city in Nandigrama until Rama
returns again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he clad himself in bark and went to the jungle.
There he conducted the affairs of government, holding
the royal umbrella over Rama's sandals. All presents
which were given were first presented to the sandals,
because Bharata ruled the kingdom for his elder brother.
The sandals of Rama were the symbol of royal authority.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Rama with Sita and Lakshmana went
southward towards deeper jungles, visiting various holy
sages, and having crossed the Vindhya mountains, they
wandered together in the Deccan and Southern India.
At Panchavati<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>, nigh to the sources of the river Godavari,
the royal exiles built a hut with four rooms, and
lived peaceful and pious lives. Thirteen years and a half
went over their heads.</p>

<p>It came to pass that one day there came to the quiet
hermitage a Rakshasa woman, named Surpa-nakha, the
sister of Ravana, the demon King of Lanka, Ceylon.
She was misshapen and ugly and her voice was harsh
and unpleasant. When she beheld Rama, who was
comely as a lotus, and of lofty and loyal bearing, her
heart was filled with love for him. Made bold with this
love, she resolved to assume another form so as to induce
him to leave the faithful Sita.... In time she
stood before the prince in the guise of a young and
beautiful woman, and said: &#8220;Who art thou who hast
come hither with thy bride to dwell in this lone jungle
which is haunted by Rakshasas?&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><i>From the painting by Warwick Goble</i></p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span></p>

<p>Said Rama: &#8220;I am Rama, the elder son of a Maharajah
named Dasaratha. I dwell here in exile in fulfilment
of my sire's vow, with Sita, my spouse, and Lakshmana,
my brother. Why dost thou, O fair one, who art as
beautiful as the bride of Vishnu, wander about here all
alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>Surpa-nakha said: &#8220;I am a Rakshasa woman, the
sister of Ravana, and have come hither because I love
thee. I have chosen thee for my husband, and thou
shalt rule over my great empire. Thy Sita is pale and
deformed and unworthy of thee, but I am of surpassing
beauty and have power to assume any form at will. I
must devour Sita and thy brother, so that we may range
the jungle together and visit the lofty hills.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Rama: &#8220;Sita is my beloved bride, nor would
I leave her. But Lakshmana hath no consort and is a fit
husband for thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Surpa-nakha at once departed from Rama, and went
and found Lakshmana, who jested with her.</p>

<p>Then the enraged Rakshasa woman sprang towards
Sita in jealous anger, but Rama thrust her back. Like
to lightning Lakshmana leapt forward with his sword and
cut off the ears and nose of the evil-hearted Surpa-nakha,
whereat she shrieked and fled away, wailing like to the
storm wind. The rocks answered back her awesome
cries.</p>

<p>Surpa-nakha hastened to one of her brothers who
was named Khara, and when he saw her disfigured and
bleeding, he cried: &#8220;None but a Celestial could have
done this deed. This day will I drink the blood of
Indra as a crane drinks milk and water.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Surpa-nakha related what had taken place, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
said: &#8220;Rama and Lakshmana attacked me to protect
the woman Sita, whose life-blood I desired to drink. I
entreat thee to bring her to me now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Khara called upon fourteen Rakshasas and commanded
them to capture the three royal hermits who dwelt in
Dandaka jungle. They hastened away and Surpa-nakha
went with them, but soon she returned wailing, because
Rama had slain the Rakshasas with Celestial arrows.</p>

<p>Khara immediately called upon his brother Dush´ana,
saying: &#8220;Assemble an army of fourteen thousand Rakshasas,
and bring my weapons and my chariot with white
horses, for, verily, this day I must kill the hateful Rama.&#8221;</p>

<p>Evil were the omens as the army marched to battle.
Jackals howled and birds screamed at dawn; the sky was
blood-red, and Rahu endeavoured to swallow the sun and
caused an awesome eclipse; a headless horror appeared in
mid air. The arrows of Rama emitted smoke, and he said
to Lakshmana: &#8220;Hasten with Sita to a secret cave in the
mountains and protect her there. I will battle with the
demons alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lakshmana did as his brother commanded. Then
Rama girt on his glowing armour, and, armed with a
Celestial bow and many arrows, he awaited the coming of
his enemies. When the Rakshasas appeared they quailed
before him, because he appeared like to Yama at a Yuga
end, but Khara drove on in his chariot, urging his followers
to attack; they followed him roaring like a tempest,
and they appeared like to black tremendous clouds rushing
towards the rising sun.</p>

<p>Thousands of weapons were showered against Rama,
who began to discharge flaming arrows, which swept among
the Rakshasas like fire in a sun-dried forest, so that many
were mangled and slain. Still Khara and his brother continued
to attack; but Rama seized a great Celestial weapon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
and slew Dushana and scattered the demon army in
flight. Khara sought to avenge his brother's death, but
Rama drew his bow and shot a blazing arrow which consumed
him instantly. So was the battle won, and Sita
came forth from the cave and embraced her heroic husband
and kissed him.</p>

<p>Of all the Rakshasa host only Surpa-nakha escaped
alive. She hastened to Lanka and informed the ten-headed
King Ravana of the death of his brothers, and
said: &#8220;Thou canst not defeat Rama in battle. But he
may be overcome by guile. He hath a beautiful spouse,
whose name is Sita, and she is dearer to him than life.
If thou wilt take her captive, Rama can be slain, because
he is unable to exist without her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Ravana: &#8220;I will bring Sita hither in my chariot.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the morrow Ravana and his brother Maricha,
whom Rama had aforetime driven far across the ocean
with a Celestial weapon, went towards the hermitage of
the royal exiles in a resplendent chariot which went
through the air like a great bird; it was drawn by asses
which had the heads of Rakshasas.</p>

<p>Maricha assumed the shape of a golden deer with
silvern spots; its horns were tipped with sapphire and its
eyes were like to blue lotus blooms. This beautiful
animal of gentle seeming grazed below the trees until
Sita beheld it with wondering eyes as she came forth to
pluck wild flowers. She called to Rama, saying: &#8220;A
deer of wondrous beauty is wandering through the grove.
I long to rest at ease on its golden skin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Rama: &#8220;O Lakshmana, I must fulfil the desire
of Sita. Tarry with her until I obtain this animal for
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>So speaking, he lifted his bow and hastened away
through the trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span></p>

<p>Lakshmana spoke to Sita and said: &#8220;My heart is full
of misgiving. Sages have told that Rakshasas are wont to
assume the forms of deer. Ofttimes have monarchs been
waylaid in the forest by artful demons who came to lure
them away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rama chased the deer a long time hither and thither
through the forest, and at length he shot an arrow which
pierced its heart. In his agony Maricha sprang out of
the deer's body, and cried out in imitation of Rama's
voice: &#8220;<i>Sita, Sita, save me! O save me, Lakshmana!</i>&#8221;
Then he died, and Rama perceived that he had slain the
Rakshasa Maricha, brother of Ravana.</p>

<p>Sita's heart was filled with alarm when she heard the
voice of the Rakshasa calling in imitation of her husband.
She spake to Lakshmana, saying: &#8220;Hasten and help my
Rama; he calls for help.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Lakshmana: &#8220;Do not fear for Rama, O fair one.
No Rakshasa can injure him. I must obey his command
and remain beside thee. The cry thou hast heard is an
illusion wrought by demons.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sita was wroth; her eyes sparkled and her voice shook
as she spake, saying: &#8220;Hath thine heart grown callous?
Art thou thy brother's enemy? Rama is in peril, and
yet thou dost not hasten to succour him. Hast thou
followed him to the forest desiring that he should die, so
as to obtain his widow by force? If so, thy hope is a
delusion, because I will not live one moment after he dies.
It is useless, therefore, for thee to tarry here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Lakshmana, whose eyes were filled with tears:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
&#8220;I do not fear for Rama.... O Sita! thy words scald
me, for thou art as a mother unto me. I cannot answer
thee. My heart is free from sin.... Alas! that fickle
women with poisonous tongues should endeavour to set
brother against brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sita wept, and Lakshmana, repenting that he had
spoken harshly, said: &#8220;I will obey thee and hasten unto
Rama. May the spirits of the forest protect thee against
hidden enemies. I am troubled because I behold evil
omens. When I return, may I behold Rama by thy
side.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Sita: &#8220;If Rama is slain I will die by drowning,
or by poison, or else by the noose. I cannot live without
Rama.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ravana kept watch the while, and when he saw Lakshmana
leaving the hermitage, he assumed the guise of a
forest sage and went towards the lonely and sad-hearted
Sita. The jungle had grown silent. Ravana saw that
Sita was beautiful as the solitary moon at midnight when
it illumines the gloomy forest. He spake, saying: &#8220;O
woman of golden beauty, O shy one in full bloom, robed
in silk and adorned with flowers, art thou Sri, or Gauri,<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>
or the goddess of love, or a nymph of the forest? Red
as coral are thy lips; thy teeth shine like to jasmine; love
dwelleth in thine eyes so soft and lustrous. Slender art
thou and tall, with shapely limbs, and a bosom like to
ripe fruit.... Wherefore, O fair one, with long shining
tresses, dost thou linger here in the lonesome jungle?
More seemly it were if thou didst adorn a stately palace.
Choose thee a royal suitor; be the bride of a king.
What god is thy sire, O beautiful one?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sita honoured Ravana, believing that he was a Brahman.
She told him the story of Rama's exile, and said: &#8220;Rest
thyself here until the jungle-ranging brethren return to
greet thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Ravana said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span> &#8220;No Brahman am I, but the ruler
of the vengeful Rakshasas. I am Ravana, King of Lanka,
dreaded by even the gods. Thy beauty, O fair one, clad
in yellow silk, has taken captive my heart. Be my chief
queen, O Sita, and five thousand handmaidens will wait
upon thee. Share mine empire and my fame.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Sita, whose eyes flashed fiery anger: &#8220;Knowest
thou Rama, the god-like hero who is ever victorious in
strife? I am his wedded wife. Knowest thou Rama,
the sinless and saintly one, who is strongly armed and
full of valour and virtue? I am his wedded wife. What
madness hath prompted thee to woo the wife of so mighty
a warrior? I follow Rama as a lioness follows a lion.
Canst thou, a prowling jackal, hope to obtain a lioness?
Snatch from the jaws of a lion the calf which it is devouring,
touch the fang of a cobra when it seizeth a fallen
victim, or tear up a mountain by the roots, or seize the
sun in heaven before thou dost seek to win or capture the
wife of Rama, the avenger.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ravana boasted his prowess, saying: &#8220;I have power
to slay even Yama. I can torture the sun and shoot
arrows through the earth. Little dost thou know of my
glory and my heroism.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he changed his shape and stood up in gigantic
demon form with vast body and ten heads and twenty
arms.... Seizing Sita, he soared through the air with
her as Garuda carries off the queen of serpents; he
placed her in his chariot and went away swifter than the
wind.</p>

<p>The unseen spirits of the jungle looked on, and they
heard the cries of Sita as she called in vain for Rama and
Lakshmana. Jatayus<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>, Monarch of Vultures, who lay
asleep on a mountain top, heard her and awoke; he
darted upon Ravana like to the thunderbolt of Indra. A
fierce battle was fought in mid air. Jatayus destroyed
the chariot and killed the Rakshasa asses, but Ravana
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>took Sita in his arms, and, soaring higher than the
Vulture king, disabled him with his sword.</p>

<p>Then Ravana continued his journey towards Lanka,
floating in the air. As he passed over the Mountain of
Apes, Sita contrived to cast off her ornaments, and they
dropped through the air like falling stars.... The five
apes found them and said: &#8220;Ravana is carrying away
some beautiful woman who calls upon Rama and Lakshmana.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Ravana reached his palace he delivered Sita to
a band of Rakshasa women, commanding them to guard
her by day and by night.</p>

<p>Long and loudly did Rama lament when he returned
to the forest hut and found that it was empty. He knew
that Sita had been carried away, but whither he knew not.</p>

<p>Rama wept for Sita. He searched hither and thither
through the forest, and called on every mountain and tree
and on every bird and every beast, asking whither she
had gone. When he found a tattered garland which his
loved one had worn, he swooned with overpowering
grief.</p>

<p>Then Lakshmana sprinkled water drops on his face
until he revived. &#8220;Alas! my brother,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;do
not sorrow thus lest death should snatch thee away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Rama: &#8220;Sita is my heart's love. I cannot live
without her. For my sake she deserted the royal palace
to wander in this fearsome jungle. Now that she is gone,
the moments seem longer than years.... How can I
live on when she is lost to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lakshmana comforted his brother: then they arose
together and continued their vain search.... Rama<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
beheld a beauteous lotus in a clear stream, and, blinded
with tears, he deemed it was the face of Sita. &#8220;O hard-hearted
one,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;art thou hiding there among
the water blooms? Seekest thou to test my love in this
manner? Arise and come to me, my sweet love, nor
doubt me any longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the bloom moved not, and Lakshmana led away
his grief-distracted brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mayhap she hath returned to the hut now,&#8221; Rama
cried. Then the brethren hastened to the hermitage, but
found it empty as before.... Rama wailed in the moonlight
and cried to the orb of night: &#8220;O moon! mankind
welcome thy coolness, but thou dost bring to me naught
but sorrow and tears.... Thou lookest over the whole
world, beholding all living beings. Where, O tell me,
where is my beloved one, my lost Sita?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rama wandered fitfully through the jungle: the
moonbeams and the shadows fluttered around, and it
seemed as if the face of Sita were peering from everywhere.
So passed a sleepless night, full of mourning
and illusions.</p>

<p>On the morrow the brethren went forth again in
quest of the lost one. They came to the place where
Jatayus lay dying, and that lordly bird spake to Rama
and related all that had befallen Sita and himself.</p>

<p>Rama sat on the ground: he embraced the dying
Vulture King, and said unto Lakshmana:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span> &#8220;Alas! my
brother, the noble Jatayus hath given up his life to
serve me. I have lost my kingdom and my sire; I have
lost Sita, and now our ally, the Rajah of Vultures, is
dying.... All my friends are passing away. If I were
to sit in the shade of a tree, the tree would fall; if I
stooped to drink water from a river, verily the river
would dry up....&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he spake to Jatayus, saying: &#8220;Whither hath
Ravana gone with my well-beloved?&#8221;</p>

<p>Said the Vulture: &#8220;He went southward towards an
unknown forest fastness.... Alas! my strength fails,
mine eyes grow blind, my life is ebbing from my body.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he had spoken thus, Jatayus died in Rama's
arms, and his soul ascended to the heaven of Vishnu in a
chariot of fire.</p>

<p>Thereafter the brethren went towards the south. On
their way they met a black demon of monstrous size; his
head was in the middle of his body; he had but one eye,
and his teeth were numerous and long. Suddenly the
misshapen demon stretched out his two great arms, and
the brethren fought against the arms.</p>

<p>The demon cried: &#8220;Who are ye that dare to combat
with me? I welcome ye because I am an hungered this
day, and long to feast on human flesh.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rama and Lakshmana fought on until they cleft both
the great arms that were coiled around them, whereat the
monster fell upon the ground. Said Rama: &#8220;We are
Dasaratha's sons, who are exiles in the jungle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the demon revealed that he was Kabandha, and
bade them burn his body, so that he might be bereft of
his Rakshasa form and nature; thereafter, he promised,
he would inform them regarding Sita. The brethren dug
a pit and cremated the monster, and from the fire arose
Kabandha, the Gandharva, who had been placed under
spells. He spake and said: &#8220;Ravana dwells in the island
of Lanka; he is the King of Rakshasas. If thou wouldst
fain overcome him, thou must seek the aid of the ape
chief, Sugriva, King of the Vanars, who dwells on Rishyamukha
mountain.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p>When the brethren went towards this mountain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>Hanuman, son of Vayu, the wind god, a counsellor of
the Ape King, came forth to meet them. He conducted
Rama and Lakshmana before Sugriva, to whom they
related the story of Sita's abduction.</p>

<p>Said Sugriva: &#8220;Some days past I beheld a woman
who was borne aloft in the arms of a flying Rakshasa;
she threw down her ornaments, which we have preserved
with care.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the ornaments were brought forth, and they
were recognized by Lakshmana, but Rama wept so profusely
that he knew not whether he gazed upon the jewels
of Sita or not.</p>

<p>Sugriva, who was the son of Surya, the sun god,
desired to aid Rama, but he told that his bride and his
kingdom had been taken from him by his half-brother
Bali, son of Indra, whom he feared.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> Then Rama promised
to slay Bali and restore the kingdom to Sugriva.
And as he promised so did he do. Sugriva challenged
his brother to single combat, and Rama discharged an
arrow which pierced the heart of the usurper. All the
apes rejoiced greatly when the rightful King of the Vanars
was restored to his throne.</p>

<p>The rainy season came on soon afterwards, and Rama
and Lakshmana went to dwell upon the mountain Malyavana,
where they found a cave.</p>

<p>Slowly passed the days of waiting. Ofttimes did Rama
grieve for Sita. He was wont to speak to Lakshmana,
saying:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span> &#8220;Delightful is the season of rain and tempest
unto those who dwell in happy homes in the midst of
their families; it is a time of sorrow to those who suffer
separation.... Behold the great black clouds like to
battling elephants leaping and rolling in heaven. Thunder
roars amidst the mountains. The lightnings flash and
sparkle; alas! their golden lustre in the darkness of night
reminds me of my lost Sita.... Now the wind falls
and the earth is bright with rain tears, and I hear the
sighing of Sita as she weeps in pain and sorrow....
The rainbow comes forth in beauty like to Sita arrayed
with jewels and ornaments.... Now the earth is refreshed:
trees are budding and flowers bloom again in
beauty, but I cannot be consoled. Lost is Sita, my dearly
beloved; she writhes in the palace of the Rakshasa king
as the lightning writhes amidst the black clouds....
Ah! I abandoned my throne and kingdom with joy because
Sita was with me; now my heart is breaking because
she hath been snatched away.... See how the shadows
gather again; winds roar and rains pour down; as dubious
is my future, and dark as is this gloomy day of sorrow.
Jatayus hath told that Sita is concealed in a distant fastness....
How can I be consoled? I mourn not for
myself alone, but chiefly because she whom I love sorrows
and suffers in a strange land.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, when Sita was dwelling in the palace of the
demon king, guarded by Rakshasa women, Ravana approached
her again and again, and addressed to her sweet
speeches, praising her beauty and endeavouring to win
her love. But Sita rejected him with scorn. Although
she was his prisoner, he could not win her by force. She
was strengthened by her own virtue; she was protected
by Brahma's dread decree. Be it known that once upon
a time the lustful Ravana had seized by force a nymph of
Indra's heaven, whose name was Punjikashthala. When
he committed that evil offence, Brahma spake angrily and
said that Ravana's head would be rent asunder if ever
again he attempted to act in like manner towards another
female in heaven or upon earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span></p>

<p>Sita said unto the demon king: &#8220;Thou shalt never
have me for wife either in this world or in the next.
Rather would I die than gratify thy desire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Angry was Ravana, and he commanded the female
Rakshasas to convey Sita to the Asoka grove, believing
that her heart would be melted by the beauties of that
fair retreat. &#8220;Thou wilt provide her with fine raiment,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;and with rich ornaments and delicious food,
thou wilt praise me before her, and anon threaten her
with dire calamity if she refuseth to become my bride.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sita remembered Rama in her heart by day and by
night, and wept and moaned for him, refusing to be
comforted.</p>

<p>When the rainy season was drawing to a close, Rama
fretted because Sugriva, King of the Vanars, was making
no effort to collect his forces and prepare for the recovery
of Sita. Instead, he drank wine and spent the days in
merriment among his wives. At length Lakshmana
visited the palace and threatened Sugriva with death,
because he had broken his promise, whereat the monarch
summoned speedily his great armies of apes and bears in
countless numbers. Four divisions were then sent out
to the north and the south, and eastward and westward,
to search for Sita.</p>

<p>Success attended the efforts of the army commanded
by Hanuman. It chanced that his officers discovered on
a mountain summit Sampati, the brother of Jatayus, King
of the Vultures. He was wounded and helpless, because
his wings had been scorched by endeavouring to soar to
the sun so that he might fulfil a vain boast. Although
stricken thus, Sampati could still see clearly over vast
distances. He had beheld Ravana carrying away Sita
across the ocean towards Lanka. This knowledge he
communicated through his son to Hanuman. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
he rendered such great service to Rama his wings began
to grow, and he was enabled once again to take flight
athwart the blue heaven.</p>

<p>Hanuman then resolved to visit the distant island
with purpose to discover where Sita had been hidden.
Assuming gigantic form, he stood upon a mountain top
and leapt seaward. The mountain shook when he sprang
from it. Over the sea went the wind god's son and that
swiftly. But demons endeavoured to arrest his progress
through the air. Surasa, mother of the Nagas, rose up
with gaping jaws, and cried: &#8220;Thou must needs pass
through my mouth ere thou wilt go farther, O Hanuman.&#8221;</p>

<p>The heroic Ape extended his bulk, but the Naga hag
opened wider and wider her jaws to prevent him passing.
Then Hanuman shrank to the size of a man's thumb,
and leapt into her mouth and out of it again and again so
as to fulfil her conditions, whereat the hag owned that
she was defeated and allowed him to pass.</p>

<p>Next arose the she dragon, Sinhika, who clutched the
shadow of Hanuman and held him back. Wrathfully
she sprang forward to devour him, but again the cunning
Ape contracted himself, and entering her mouth, attacked
her and wounded her so that she was slain.</p>

<p>Leaping from her body, Hanuman resumed his journey
until he arrived at Lanka. Night had fallen but the
moon shone brightly. He assumed the form of a cat
and crept stealthily through the capital, gazing on the
wonders about him. He reached the great palace of
Ravana and entered therein. It had shining crystal floors
and jewelled stairways of gold and silver. The mansion
of Indra was not more beautiful than that resplendent
palace of the demon king. Hanuman crept on through
the women's chamber, and beheld fair forms &#8220;subdued
in all the shapes of sleep&#8221;; beautiful were they as lotus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
blooms that await the sun's first kiss ere they open their
soft eyelids, or as the lustrous stars on an autumn night
gleaming and moving in heaven; it seemed as if a wreath
of sweet human blossoms had been thrown carelessly into
that perfumed chamber of sleep.</p>

<p>Hanuman wandered on until he reached the Asoka
grove. There he beheld the long-lost Sita, the queen of
stars. Fierce she demons surrounded her, and some
were of fearsome shape; they had dogs' heads and pigs'
heads and the faces of horses and buffaloes; some were
of great bulk and others were dwarfish; some had but one
eye and others had three eyes; the ears of some hung
touching the ground; others that were hairy were the
most horrible to behold.</p>

<p>When morning came Ravana drew nigh to plead his
love, praising the beauty of Sita, but she rejected him, as
she had ofttimes done before, whereat the demon grew
angry and threatened her with dire tortures and even
death.... Sita was like to a gentle fawn surrounded by
wolves. Yet she was without fear. Rather would she
perish than be unfaithful to Rama.</p>

<p>Hanuman kept watch, crouching in the branches of a
tree, and at length he found it possible to approach her
in secret. At first she feared that Ravana had assumed
the form of Hanuman to deceive her, but she was reassured
when the Vanar spy showed her the ring of Rama,
and related how greatly he sorrowed because she had been
taken from him. Then was her heart touched with
sorrow mingled with joy. Hanuman offered to carry her
away, but in her modesty she refused to touch the body
of any male being save Rama. She took from her hair a
bright jewel which she gave to Hanuman as a token; and
she said that Ravana had allowed her but two months to
live if she refused to yield to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span></p>

<p>Hanuman desired, ere he left the city of Ravana, to
show his enmity against the demons. Assuming his
gigantic form, he uprooted trees and destroyed fair
mansions. The guards came out against him and he
slew many of them. But, at length, the mighty Indrajit,
son of Ravana, hastened forth and shot a magic serpent-shaft
which enwrapped Hanuman like a noose, and rendered
him helpless. Thus was he taken prisoner, and he
was dragged before Ravana, who commanded that the
Ape be put to death. But a counsellor intervened and
advised that Hanuman should be regarded as an envoy,
and treated with dishonour ere he was sent back, so that
their enemies might be terrified. Ravana consented to this
course, and an oil-soaked cloth was tied round the Ape's
great tail and set on fire. But Sita prayed that the fire
should not injure Hanuman, and her prayer was heard.
The son of Vayu suddenly contracted his body so that
his bonds fell from him, and he leapt over the city,
setting fire with his flaming tail to many mansions, and
so accomplishing great destruction. Then he obtained
another brief interview with Sita, and once again leapt
over the ocean; he hastened with the good tidings of his
journey to Rama, who rejoiced greatly that his loved one
had been found.</p>

<p>Preparations were at once begun to rescue Sita. The
Vanar armies were marched southward, and they camped
on the shore over against Lanka, which lies sixty miles
from the mainland. Here they were joined by a new
and powerful ally.</p>

<p>Be it known that the mighty deeds of Hanuman had
stricken terror to the heart of Ravana. The demon king
summoned a council of war to consider what should be
done. All his warriors advised him to wage war, except
Bibhishana, his younger brother, who censured the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
monarch for the offence which he had committed against
blameless Rama. &#8220;Hear my words,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
restore Sita to her rightful lord, or else Rama will swoop
down upon thy kingdom, O Ravana, as a falcon who
seizeth his prey. Make peace with him now, lest many
perish in battle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ravana was made angry, and cried: &#8220;Alas! for the
love of my near relatives, who sorrow at my fame and
smile at my peril; they are ever jealous and full of guile,
because they hate me in their secret hearts.... Evil is
thy speech, O Bibishana. Depart from me, false prince,
and carry thy treason to our enemies.... If thou wert
not my brother I would slay thee even now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bibhishana was thus banished from the Rakshasa kingdom,
and he immediately crossed the sea and joined the
forces of Rama.</p>

<p>Rama performed sacrifices to propitiate the God of
Ocean, so that the Vanar forces might be enabled to pass
over to Lanka, but these proved to be unavailing. Then
angrily he seized his bow and shot Celestial weapons into
the bosom of the deep. The earth and the sea were
immediately convulsed, and darkness covered the heavens;
lightning flashed and thunder bellowed aloud; the mountains
began to break in pieces. Rama next seized a
fiery dart and threatened to dry up the waters of the
sea.</p>

<p>At that moment the King of Ocean rose serenely above
the weltering billows in all his splendour, attended by
shining water snakes. He addressed Rama with great
reverence, reminding him that according to ancient laws
he must remain unfordable, but counselling him the while
to seek the aid of the Vanar chief Nala, son of Vishwakarma,
the divine artisan, so that a bridge might be constructed
to enable the armies to cross the deep. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
the King of Ocean vanished amidst the waves and the
heavens brightened again.</p>

<p>Nala was immediately called upon to give his aid.
Assisted by his workmen, this wonderful Vanar, whose
body was green, constructed a causeway of rocky islands
between the mainland and Lanka (Ceylon), and to this
day it is called &#8220;Rama's Bridge&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<p>Rama meanwhile set up the Linga symbol of the god
Shiva, and worshipped it on that holy island which hath
since been called Ramisseram.</p>

<p>In five days the strait was spanned. Then Rama
mounted on the back of Hanuman, son of the wind god
Vayu, and Lakshmana mounted the back of Angada, son
of Bali and grandson of Indra, and led the Vanar hosts
across the sea. The apes and bears which composed the
great attacking army leapt from island to island, shouting:
&#8220;Victory to Rama!&#8221; &#8220;Victory to Lakshmana!&#8221; &#8220;Victory
to Sugriva!&#8221; Now the apes were of many colours; they
were white and black, green and blue, yellow and red and
brown. Sugriva shone like silver, Angada resembled a
white lotus; Nila, son of Agni, was red, and Hanuman
was yellow as pure gold; Sarambha had also a yellow
body, and Nala was green, while Darvindha had a black
body, a red face, and a yellow tail. These were all leaders
and great warriors of the Vanar host.</p>

<p>The army landed in Lanka unopposed, and encamped
on a plain fronting the capital of the Rakshasa king.</p>

<p>The Rakshasas issued forth speedily to attack the
apes, and the blowing of horns and beating of drums
sounded like to the mighty thunder peals at a Yuga end.
Indrajit was the Rakshasa leader. His followers rode on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>elephants and lions, on camels and asses, on hogs and
hyenas, and on wolves; they were armed with bows and
arrows, maces, spears, tridents, swords, and beams, but
some had also magic weapons. Roaring and swaying,
they drove forward like to long sea-rollers assaulting the
shore.</p>

<p>The gigantic apes wielded trees for clubs and threw
great boulders, but some depended on their sword-like
nails and their long arrowy teeth. They rushed against
the demons, shouting &#8220;Rama, Rama!&#8221; and soon the
plain was covered by heaps of writhing bodies and severed
limbs, while rivers of blood streamed across it from
between the battling hosts. Rama looked on without
fear. He reposed his faith on the apes, for he knew that
they were incarnations of the gods.</p>

<p>The apes were driven back until Sugriva flung a great
tree, which shattered the chariot of Indrajit. Then the
Rakshasa leader and his army took flight.</p>

<p>Indrajit obtained a new chariot by offering up in
sacrifice a black goat, and returning to the battlefield with
his forces he shot arrows at Rama and Lakshmana. Then
he threw a serpent noose, which bound the two brothers
so that they were unable to move. Great was their peril,
but Vayu, god of wind, sent to their aid the great
Celestial bird Garuda, the serpent killer, and the snakes
which formed the noose fled from before it, whereat the
brethren, who had meantime fallen in a swoon, rose up
again. Ravana then came forth, but Rama shot arrows
which swept the ten crowns from his ten heads, and he
retired in his shame and skulked in the city.</p>

<p>The Rakshasas were in desperate straits and bethought
them to awaken Kumbha-karna, the mightiest of all the
demons. In former days he had terrorized the Universe;
he continually devoured human beings, and had defeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
Indra even, but Brahma intervened and decreed that he
would sleep for six months and then awaken for one day
only. Each time he awoke he devoured a great meal,
after which he was again overpowered by slumber.</p>

<p>Thousands of men danced and shouted and blew
trumpets beside the great sleeper, but he could not be
wakened; elephants were driven over his body, yet he
never moved; then beautiful women came and caressed
him, and he suddenly opened his eyes and roared like to
the sea. His eyes were red with anger, and he cried:
&#8220;Why have I been awakened before my time?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Rakshasas informed Kumbha-karna of the army
which surrounded the city, and they brought him much
food; greedily he swallowed swine and deer and many
human beings and drank rivers of wine. Refreshed, but
not yet satisfied, he arose and said: &#8220;Where are the apes
so that I may devour them?&#8221;</p>

<p>He mounted his chariot and went forth to battle.
The apes trembled to behold him and fled panic-stricken....
Sugriva rallied them quickly, and then they began
to fling trees and boulders, but these were all splintered to
pieces on the limbs of the giant. He defeated Hanuman,
and seized Sugriva and carried him off in his chariot.
Thousands of apes were devoured by the mighty Rakshasa.</p>

<p>At length Kumbha-karna went against Rama and a
fierce conflict ensued, but in the end Rama discharged
flaming arrows and severed his head from his body. The
monster staggered backward and fell into the ocean, and
great billows arose and tossed angrily in the midst of the
swollen deep.</p>

<p>Indrajit thereafter offered up another sacrifice and
secured fresh weapons. Rendering himself invisible, he
rose high in the air and showered arrows like rain until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
Rama and Lakshmana, who were grievously wounded,
fell down and pretended to be dead.</p>

<p>When darkness came on, Hanuman and Bibhishana
surveyed the battlefield with torches and found that many
apes had been wounded and slain. Great was their
sorrow, but Sushena, the ape physician, bade Hanuman
to hasten to a certain Himalayan mountain to obtain healing
herbs. The wind god's son assumed tremendous
bulk, and, leaping aloft, went speedily through the air
until he reached the place where the herbs grew. He
searched for them in vain; then he tore up the mountain,
and carrying it in his hand returned again to the battlefield.
The physician soon discovered the herbs; then he
gave healing to Rama and Lakshmana and the wounded
apes, who rose up at once ready and eager to fight as
before. Hanuman returned with the mountain and restored
it to its place.</p>

<p>When the sun rose, Ravana sent forth young heroes
to battle against the apes and bears, but they were all
slain. Then Indrajit came to avenge the fallen, but
Lakshmana drew his bow and shot an arrow which Indra
had given to him. Unerring was his aim, and Indrajit
was struck down; his body rolled headless upon the plain.</p>

<p>Ravana lamented for the death of his son, crying:
&#8220;He was the mightiest of my heroes and the dearest to
my heart. All the gods feared him, yet by a mortal was
he laid low.... O my son, thy widow wails for thee
and thy mother weeps in sore distress. Fondly I deemed
that when the frailties of old age afflicted me thou wouldst
close mine eyelids in death, but youth is taken first and
I am left alone to battle against mine enemies.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a time the mighty demon wept; then he arose
in wrath to wreak vengeance. First of all he hastened
towards the Asoka grove to slay Sita. But the Rakshasa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
dames concealed the wife of Rama, and prevailed upon
Ravana not to pollute his fame by slaying a woman. One
cried to him: &#8220;Auspicious is the last day of the waning
moon. The hour of thy vengeance is nigh. Turn thee
towards the battlefield and great glory will be thine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ravana went gloomily away; he mounted his chariot
to battle against his enemies, remembering those who
had already fallen. Followed by a great army, he swept
from the city like to a tempest cloud which darkens the
summer heaven. He beheld his brother Bibhishana fighting
for Rama, and angrily cast at him a great weapon,
but Lakshmana flung a javelin which shattered it in flight.
Ravana smiled grimly and shouted to Lakshmana:
&#8220;Slayer of my son, I welcome thee! Thou hast protected
Bibhishana; now protect, if thou canst, thine own
self.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having spoken thus he flung a great dart, which
pierced the heart of Lakshmana and pinned him to the
earth.</p>

<p>Rama stooped over the fallen hero and cried: &#8220;Alas!
art thou fallen, my gallant brother? Thy weapons have
dropped from thy hands; death claims thee, but, O
Lakshmana, thou wilt not die alone. I am weary of
battle and of glory, and when my task is ended, I will
follow in thy footsteps.... The love of wife or friend
is easily won, but the love of a faithful brother, equal to
thine, is rarely found in this world of illusions....
Dearest of brothers, greatest of heroes, wilt thou never
awaken from thy deathly swoon or open again thine eyes
to behold me?... Alas! the lips of Lakshmana are
silent and his ears are stopped.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the darkness of night Hanuman again hastened
northward in speedy flight to obtain the mountain which
he had aforetime carried to Lanka. The physician found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
upon it the healing herbs; he pounded them and made
a paste which he placed under the nostrils of the unconscious
warrior. Then Lakshmana rose up again
healed and hale and powerful. Rama rejoiced greatly,
and turned against his foes.... A night attack was
made upon the Rakshasa capital, and the Apes intercepted
a sacrifice which Ravana sought to offer up to the gods
so as to compel their aid; many fair mansions were given
to the flames.</p>

<p>When day came Ravana went forth to battle. Surpa-nakha,
his sister who had caused the war, stood in his
way, and he thrust her aside impatiently, whereat she
cursed him, saying: &#8220;For this thou wilt never again
return to the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ravana drove on in battle fury, his heart filled with
hatred for his foes and with sorrow for the fallen. Rama
went against him in the chariot of Indra, and for a time a
dubious conflict was waged. The earth trembled and the
ocean shook with fear.</p>

<p>Suddenly Rama darted forward. He drew his bow
and shot a swift arrow, which smote off one of Ravana's
ten heads, but immediately another appeared in its place.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>
Then the hero seized the flaming weapon which Brahma
had created for the protection of the gods; with unerring
aim he discharged it in flaming splendour; it struck the
demon; it cleft in twain his heart of iron. Roaring in
his fierce agony Ravana fell ponderously upon the plain
and immediately expired. So was the enemy of gods
and men put to death by peerless Rama.</p>

<p>Celestial music was heard in heaven and flowers fell
upon the plain of victory: a voice came down the wind,
saying: &#8220;<i>O victor of truth and righteousness, thy task is now
ended.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span></p>
<p>The Rakshasa hosts broke in flight when Ravana fell,
and Rama entered the city in triumph. Bibhishana
burned the body of his fallen brother, and performed the
funeral rites. Thereafter he was proclaimed King of
Lanka.</p>

<p>When peace was restored, Rama commanded that
Sita should be brought forth. She was carried towards
the plain concealed in a litter, and all the Apes gathered
round to behold her, whereat Rama requested her to
alight and walk towards him, and she did so. With
folded hands she approached her husband and knelt at
his feet, weeping tears of joy.</p>

<p>Clouded was the brow of Rama; he spoke sternly,
and said: &#8220;Mine enemies are slain, and thou art delivered
from captivity, O Sita; but now that my shame is removed
I have no desire to behold thee. I cannot receive
thee as my wife, because that thou hast dwelt in the house
of Ravana.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Sita: &#8220;Chaste and innocent have I remained....
O Rama, if thou hadst informed me of thy doubt, I
would have died ere now. Better is death than thy dark
suspicion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Addressing Lakshmana, she then said: &#8220;Build for
me a funeral pyre so that I may end my grief amidst the
flames.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she desired so did the brother of Rama do. He
built the pyre and set it alight. Then Sita invoked
Agni:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Fearlessly she then leapt amidst the flames and
vanished, while all lamented around her. Rama cried:
&#8220;This day have I sinned, because she is innocent.&#8221;</p>

<p>In that hour a great wonder was wrought. Suddenly
the Deva-rishis and Gandharvas and the gods appeared in
the air. At the same time the red flames of the mighty
pyre were divided, and the god Agni came forth with
Sita, whom he delivered to Rama, saying: &#8220;<i>Receive thy
wife who is without sin or shame.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Rama embraced Sita, and said: &#8220;I have never doubted
her virtue; she is without sin, and now her purity has
been proved before all men.&#8221;</p>

<p>He wept, and Sita hid her face in his bosom and soft
embrace.</p>

<p>The exile of Rama was now ended, and he returned
speedily in the car of Indra to Ayodhya, with Sita and
Lakshmana and Hanuman.</p>

<p>Bharata welcomed his elder brother, and laid the
sandals at his feet, saying: &#8220;These are the symbols of
thy rule, O Rama; I have guarded the throne for thee.
Now take thy crown and govern thy kingdom. I give
thee back thine own.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rama was crowned on the morrow amidst the rejoicings
of the people, and prosperity returned once again to
the kingdom.</p>

<p>Time went past, but the sorrows of Sita were not
ended. The people whispered against the fair queen,
doubting her virtue, because that she had been taken
away by Ravana, and they wondered Rama had received
her back. At length her husband, yielding to the wishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
of his subjects, banished the innocent queen from the
kingdom. The faithful Lakshmana conducted her towards
the southern jungles, and abandoned her nigh to
the hermitage of Valmiki, counselling her with tears to
take refuge with the saintly poet.</p>

<p>Valmiki received her with pity, and soon afterwards
she gave birth to two sons, who were named Lava and
Kusa.</p>

<p>Sixteen years went past, and Rama's mind was troubled
because that he had slain Ravana, who was the son of
Pulastya, the Rishi. So he resolved to perform the
Aswamedha (horse sacrifice) to cleanse his soul of sin.</p>

<p>The horse was sent forth to wander through the land,
and when it approached the hermitage of Valmiki, Lava
and Kusa, the sons of Rama and Sita, took possession of
it. They defeated the royal army and wounded Satrughna.
Lakshmana hastened forth with another army, but he
was also grievously wounded and defeated by the young
heroes. Then Rama himself went southward to wage
war and recapture the horse. When his sons came forth
against him, Rama wondered to find that they were so
like to himself in countenance and bearing; his heart was
filled with tenderness, and he asked them: &#8220;Whose children
are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lava and Kusa greeted him with reverence, and said:
&#8220;Sita is our mother, but we know not the name of our
sire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Rama perceived that the lads were his own
sons.... Valmiki, the sage, came towards him, and
Rama said: &#8220;The people spoke evil things against Sita,
and it was necessary to prove her innocence. Now let
her be taken into my presence, for I know that these
noble children are mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Valmiki returned to Sita and asked her to go with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
him before Rama, but for a time she refused to do so.
The sage pleaded with her, and at length she walked
forth from the hermitage with downcast eyes and hands
uplifted. In the presence of Rama and the people she
then invoked the Earth, and cried:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If unstained in thought and action I have lived from day of birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spare a daughter's shame and anguish and receive her, Mother Earth!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If in duty and devotion I have laboured undefiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mother Earth! who bore this woman, once again receive thy child!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If in truth unto my husband I have proved a faithful wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mother Earth! relieve thy Sita from the burden of this life!<br /></span>
</div>
<p class="poematrib"><i>R. C. Dutt's trans.</i></p>
</div>

<p>When she had spoken thus, all who heard her wept
and sorrowed. And while they gazed upon her with pity
and tenderness, the earth suddenly yawned, and from its
depths arose a golden throne sparkling with gems and
supported by four great serpents, as a rose is supported
by green leaves. Then the Earth Mother appeared and
hailed Sita with loving words, and led her to the throne,
on which she seated herself beside her sinless daughter,
the faithful and undefiled wife of Rama.... The throne
thereafter vanished and the earth closed over it.</p>

<p>So passed Sita from before the eyes of all mankind.
Rama flung himself upon the ground in an agony of
sorrow. But Brahma appeared and spake to him, saying:
&#8220;Why dost thou despair, O Lord of all? Well thou
knowest that life is but a dream, a bubble of water....&#8221;</p>

<p>Rama, however, even after the Aswamedha had been
performed, continued to mourn until the Celestial bird<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
Garuda came for him: then he ascended to heaven, as
Vishnu, and found Sita, who was the goddess Lakshmi,
the incomparable Sri.</p>

<p>So endeth the story of Rama, whose fame can never
die.</p>

<h3>Transcriber's note:</h3>

<p>What appeared to be clear typographical errors were corrected; any
other mistakes or inconsistencies were retained.</p>

<p>When an image was placed in the middle of a paragraph, part of the
paragraph was moved to keep the whole paragraph united.</p>

<p>Attributions to quotations that were on the same line as the quotation
itself were moved to a separate line.</p>

<p>On many of the transcriptions used in this book, an acute accent is
used when an apostrophe would be expected by most readers. This usage
was retained.</p>

<p>Many words are spelled inconsistently, especially Indian and
other non-English words. These were retained as published as
it is impossible to know which is the spelling originally
intended (e.g.: Gar´uda/Garuda/Garúda; Damayantí/Damayanti;
Narada/Nárada; Váhuká/Váhuka/Vahuka; Ayodhyá/Ayodhya; Oudh/Oude;
Bhagavadgita/Bhagavad-gita; demi-god/demigod; Ulúpí/Ulupi;
Dioscuri/Dioskouri; etc.)</p>

<p>"Aryo-Indian" appeared consistently in the Index as "Ayro-Indian". This
was corrected.</p>

<p>Punctuation on the index was very inconsistent and was made as
consistent as possible.</p>

<p>Pages indicated on the index are retained as on the published book, even
in the few cases where they may be wrong.</p>

<p>On <a href="#Page_9">page 9</a> there are two anchors for <a href="#Footnote_47_47">footnote 47</a>. It is not clear if
this is intended or a mistake and was retained as on the published book.</p>
